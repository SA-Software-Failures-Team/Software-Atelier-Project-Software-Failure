                Transport and aerospace are vital to global stability, enabling trade, communication, and mobility across nations.
                As these sectors increasingly rely on complex software systems, their efficiency and safety depend on
                technological precision and reliability. Ensuring the resilience and security of these systems is therefore
                essential to protect both economic continuity and human safety worldwide.

                Energy and infrastructure systems are the backbone of modern society, powering everything from grids to water plants.
                A single software failure — be it a bug or cyberattack — can trigger blackouts, disrupt essential services,
                and threaten national security. Protecting this digital infrastructure is vital for societal survival.

                Business-critical systems support essential organizational functions like finance, logistics, and customer service.
                Their failure can cause major financial loss or reputational harm. Ensuring reliability and recovery capability
                is crucial for business continuity.

                Healthcare technology is central to patient safety, from diagnostics to life-support systems.
                Software bugs or vulnerabilities are direct threats to human lives — a single error can result in
                misdiagnosis or treatment failure. Reliability here is a matter of life and death.
