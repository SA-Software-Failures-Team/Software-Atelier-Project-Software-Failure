                <summary>What is the goal of the Catastrophic Failure Systems project?</summary>
                <p>
                    The project aims to study both famous and lesser-known software failures that had catastrophic impacts
                    — financially, socially, or in terms of human safety.  
                    Our goal is to create a well-documented digital archive of critical software <strong>bugs</strong> and
                    <strong>vulnerabilities</strong>, explaining their causes, consequences, and lessons learned.

                <summary>What is the difference between a software bug and a software vulnerability?</summary>
                <p>
                    A <strong>bug</strong> is typically an unintentional coding error that causes unexpected behavior in a program.  
                    A <strong>vulnerability</strong>, instead, is a weakness that can be deliberately exploited by attackers to
                    perform unauthorized actions. While both can cause failures, vulnerabilities have additional security implications.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>How do software failures impact society?</summary>
                <p>
                    Software failures can lead to <strong>economic losses, system outages, data breaches, and even loss of life</strong>.  
                    They can shut down transportation networks, disable power grids, or disrupt healthcare systems.
                    In a hyperconnected world, a single critical bug can ripple across industries globally.
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>How can developers prevent catastrophic vulnerabilities?</summary>
                <p>
                    Developers can follow <strong>secure coding practices</strong> such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Input validation and sanitization</li>
                        <li>Proper error handling</li>
                        <li>Regular code reviews and penetration testing</li>
                        <li>Using memory-safe languages or tools</li>
                        <li>Keeping dependencies and libraries up-to-date</li>
                    </ul>
                    Preventing vulnerabilities is a proactive effort that must be part of the entire software lifecycle.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why is documentation important in this project?</summary>
                <p>
                    Documentation allows us to transform failures into <strong>learning opportunities</strong>.  
                    By studying causes and consequences, developers, engineers, and students can understand how
                    to prevent similar incidents in the future. It’s about creating awareness through real-world lessons.
