            <h1>What Happened</h1>
            <p>
       The major migration event commenced on the weekend of 22–23 April 2018, when TSB moved millions of customer accounts and associated data from Lloyds-based hosting into its new Sabadell-owned platform Proteo4UK. Immediately after go-live, critical problems began to manifest: Many customers could not access online or mobile banking because authentication systems failed or returned errors.
       Branch and telephone banking services likewise faltered, as the new system interfaces and underlying services failed to stabilise.
       Some customers saw account information that did not belong to them or saw transactions missing. For example, data-integrity issues were reported.
       The problems extended for weeks: it was reported that it took until December 2018 for business-as-usual service levels to be declared.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The root causes included a “big-bang” migration approach (all or large parts migrated live at once), insufficient full-volume data testing, reliance on complex outsourcing chains, and inadequate governance of the migration programme. As one review pointed out: “The TSB IT migration was the most complex change programme TSB has ever carried out … planning for migration began more than four years before the main migration event … yet despite that the migration was followed by extensive service disruption.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
             Operationally, the consequences were severe: customers unable to view or use their accounts, delays in payments, cash-flow issues, and reputational damage. The regulators noted that TSB “failed to organise and control the IT migration programme adequately” and that technical failures “ultimately resulted in customers being unable to access banking services”.
