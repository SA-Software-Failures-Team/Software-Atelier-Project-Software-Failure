            <h2>Financial Losses</h2>
The bank was fined £48.65 million by the UK regulators (Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)) for failures of operational risk management and governance in respect of the migration.
TSB paid roughly £32.7 million in customer redress due to the service disruption.
Estimated wider cost (including remediation, lost productivity, reputational damage and customer attrition) has been cited at around £330 million in some industry commentary.
Social and Customer Impact
At its peak, a “significant proportion” of TSB’s 5.2 million customers were affected by the outage: locked-out accounts, inability to make payments, loss of access to branch/online services.
For many customers the disruption had real-world consequences: inability to access wages, pay bills, execute business transactions. Media coverage described small businesses and charities being unable to run payrolls or meet supplier payments.
The reputational damage was material: the bank’s then CEO, Paul Pester, resigned a few months later (September 2018) in the fallout of the incident.
Beyond TSB, the event raised regulatory and industry concerns around outsourcing, digital-transformation risk and operational resilience in financial services. The PRA and FCA emphasised that the case highlighted the real-world impact of failures in major change programmes.
Long-Term Consequences
The incident acted as a wake-up call for the bank and the wider sector: while TSB eventually stabilised, customers and competitors saw an opportunity; some customers switched banks.
On the regulatory front, the event helped drive greater focus on operational resilience rules, change-management governance, and senior manager accountability (including the subsequent fine of the former TSB CIO for their role).
For the bank itself, the incident forced investment into systems, vendor governance and change-control that likely cost materially (though not always publicly disclosed) — but also aimed to prevent recurence of such catastrophic failure.</p>
