            The UK bank TSB Bank plc, a challenger retail bank with approximately 5.2 million customers in the United Kingdom, embarked on a major technology transformation in the mid-2010s. The project involved migrating its customer data and services from legacy systems inherited from the Lloyds Banking Group infrastructure toward a new core banking platform (known as “Proteo4UK”) under ownership of Spanish bank Banco Sabadell.

            However, when the core migration project went live in April 2018, the system failure that ensued became one of the most serious IT incidents in UK banking history. Over the ensuing weeks, customers were locked out of accounts, seen incorrect data, and faced service interruptions across channels. The scale of the disruption meant that TSB’s continuity of critical functions was compromised — underscoring the profound risk of major IT change in business-critical systems.
