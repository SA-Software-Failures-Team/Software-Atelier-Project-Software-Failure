            <p id="first">
                In August 2022, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) was hit by a major ransomware incident that disrupted healthcare services across the country. 
                The attack did not directly target the NHS itself but rather a key software supplier called Advanced Computer Software Group, which provides essential digital systems to NHS trusts, including patient records, referrals, and emergency care platforms.

            <br><br>
            <p id="second">
                Hackers gained access through a customer account on Advanced’s systems that lacked multifactor authentication (MFA), allowing them to infiltrate the network and deploy LockBit 3.0 ransomware. 
                This sophisticated malware both encrypted files and stole data, leading to widespread system outages. 
                Hospitals and clinics using Advanced’s products, particularly mental health and community care services, suddenly lost access to vital patient information. 
                Many NHS organisations were forced to revert to manual, paper-based processes to continue treating patients.

            <br><br>
            <p id="third">
                The impact was significant: patient referrals were delayed, ambulance dispatch systems were affected, and electronic health records became temporarily unavailable. 
                Investigations later revealed that the personal data of over 80,000 individuals was at risk due to inadequate cybersecurity measures at Advanced.
