            <h2>Impact on Services & Data Exposure</h2>
            <p>The Heartbleed bug was one of the largest silent data exposures in the history of the internet. Rather than shutting down services, it let attackers read small portions of memory from any system running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL in a manner that did not leave logs or evidence behind. Since the bug had been active for more than two years before its discovery, organizations had no way to tell whether sensitive data had already been stolen.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The impact was global: millions of websites, email platforms, VPNs, mobile apps, and even hardware devices were impacted. The leaked data could include passwords, session cookies, internal application data, and-most critically-private TLS keys, which would allow attackers to decrypt encrypted traffic or impersonate trusted services. This condition put companies in a position where they had to revoke certificates, reset credentials, and rebuild cryptographic trust in their systems.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But beyond the immediate security response, Heartbleed exposed a deeper problem: The Internet was dependent on an underfunded open-source project to protect its encrypted traffic. The incident accelerated industry efforts to audit critical code, improve key-rotation policies, and support the long-term maintenance of security infrastructure. It marked a turning point in how organizations think about encryption, vulnerability management, and the hidden risks of widely shared dependencies.
