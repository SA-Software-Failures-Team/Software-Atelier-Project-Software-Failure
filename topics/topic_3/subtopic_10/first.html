            <h1>Equifax Data Breach 2017</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>What happened during the Equifax data breach?</h2>
            <p>
                Equifax is a big company in the United States that keeps people's credit information: how they pay bills, loans, and credit cards...it has personal data of millions of people!
            </p>
            <p>
                In September 2017, Equifax announced that hackers had stolen the personal data of about 147 million people. In particularly, mostly Americans, but also some Canadian and British citizens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But the most shocking thing is that the theft actually happened months earlier: the attack took place between May and July 2017, but the company discovered it and told the public only months later!
                The hackers found a known weakness in a free program called Apache Struts, which Equifax used for one of its websites.
                This problem (CVE-2017-5638) had been found and fixed in March 2017, but Equifax didn't install the update.
                Because of that, the hackers could enter the company's computers and steal private information.
                They probably learned about the weakness because it was already public, and since many companies hadn't updated their systems yet, it was an easy chance for them to attack.
            </p>

                <img src="img/equifaxworkflow.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>What data was exposed?</h2>
            <p>The stolen data included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Names</p></li>
                <li><p>Birth dates</p></li>
                <li><p>Social Security Numbers (like ID numbers in the US)</p></li>
                <li><p>Addresses</p></li>
                <li><p>License and credit card numbers</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>How did Equifax respond?</h2>
            <p>
                When Equifax found out about the data breach, it asked outside experts to help investigate what happened.
                The company offered free credit monitoring and let people freeze their credit to protect themselves.
                Some company leaders left their jobs, and Equifax promised to make its security stronger. 
                In fact, the company spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve its cybersecurity systems: 
                it created a new security team, used stronger technology, and changed how it protects personal data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What could have been done?</h2>
            <p>
                The problem happened because Equifax did not update its systems quickly!
                It is very important for all companies to use modern and updated programs. 
                Otherwise, they can be attacked easily. Big companies like Equifax are at higher risk because hackers often target them!
                Old tools can only find known problems and cannot see new attacks...            
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What were the legal and financial consequences?</h2>
            <p>
                Equifax made a deal with the U.S. government to help people affected by the breach.
                The company agreed to pay up to 425 million dollars to cover costs, fines, and support for consumers.
                Equifax has made big improvements in its security systems. 
                However, today some problems remain: customers still share negative experiences about service quality and data-accuracy issues.
                Still, many people were unhappy because Equifax took too long to act and did not protect customer data well.
