                In the long term, the VSE software failure became one of the most frequently cited examples of numerical error propagation in financial computing. 
                It prompted the adoption of more stringent standards for handling arithmetic precision in critical systems and influenced the development of quality assurance procedures for financial software. 
                The event has since been incorporated into computer science and engineering curricula as a case study demonstrating how the accumulation of seemingly negligible errors can result in substantial distortions in data integrity.

                Ultimately, the Vancouver Stock Exchange incident stands as a clear reminder that precision management is not a mere technical detail but a fundamental requirement in the design of computational systems that support financial markets. 
                Its impact extended beyond the immediate correction of a single index: it reshaped awareness of the importance of numerical stability, accurate rounding, and comprehensive testing, all of which remain essential principles in modern software engineering and financial computation.
