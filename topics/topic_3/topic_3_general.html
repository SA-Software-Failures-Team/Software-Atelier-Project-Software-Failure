                    In this topic, we will explore various instances of catastrophic software failures that have had significant impacts on society. We will analyze the causes of these failures, their consequences, and the lessons learned to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Through case studies and discussions, we aim to understand the critical role software plays in our daily lives and the importance of robust software engineering practices.
