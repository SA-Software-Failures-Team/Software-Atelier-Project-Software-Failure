                <p id="first">
                    The root cause of the January 2023 Microsoft outage was traced to a network configuration error within Microsoft’s Wide Area Network (WAN) — the global backbone connecting all Azure data centers and Microsoft 365 services. During a planned routine maintenance operation, an automated script was executed to update network configurations across routers in multiple regions. However, the script unintentionally included a faulty command that affected the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) — the system responsible for routing internet traffic efficiently. This caused large portions of Microsoft’s network routes to be withdrawn from the internet temporarily, resulting in service disconnections and severe packet loss. </p>

                <p id="second">
                    Technical analyses from independent monitoring firms, such as ThousandEyes, confirmed that the outage was not caused by a cyberattack or external interference but rather by internal misconfiguration. The BGP routing issue disrupted connectivity to key Microsoft services including Teams, Outlook, Exchange Online, and SharePoint. Because these services depend heavily on Microsoft’s centralized identity and authentication systems, the routing problem had a cascading effect, preventing users from even signing in to accounts or accessing stored data. In essence, while individual data centers remained operational, they were isolated from one another due to the routing failure.       </p>

                <p id="third">
                    Once the issue was identified, Microsoft engineers rolled back the network change and re-established stable routing sessions across its infrastructure. This rollback immediately reduced packet loss and restored normal connectivity. Microsoft later confirmed in its post-incident report that the command had been deployed without proper validation checks in place. In response, the company committed to implementing additional safeguards, including automatic “safe deployment” systems and enhanced validation protocols to prevent similar issues in the future. The incident served as a reminder that even highly automated, globally distributed cloud networks remain vulnerable to human and procedural errors.</p>
