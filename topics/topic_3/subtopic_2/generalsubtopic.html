                <h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS Lambda)</h2>
<p>
                   On June 13th, 2023, AWS Lambda experienced a significant service disruption in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region, leading to increased error rates and latency for Lambda function invocations and impacting several dependent AWS services such as STS, EKS, Connect, and EventBridge. The incident began at 11:49 AM PDT and was fully resolved by 3:37 PM PDT. The root cause was traced to a latent software defect triggered during a scaling operation within the Lambda Frontend fleet, which prevented proper utilization of allocated compute capacity. AWS engineering teams quickly identified and mitigated the issue, restoring normal operations within hours. Following the event, AWS implemented fixes to the underlying software defect and introduced architectural safeguards to prevent similar scaling-related issues in the future.
