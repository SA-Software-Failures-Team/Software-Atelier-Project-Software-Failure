                On March 10, 2021, OVHcloud, one of Europe's largest cloud and hosting providers, experienced a major incident when a fire broke out at its data center campus in Strasbourg, France. The blaze started shortly after midnight inside the SBG2 data center and rapidly spread through the building, despite immediate intervention by firefighters. SBG2 was completely destroyed, while the adjacent SBG1 facility suffered partial structural damage. To ensure safety, the two remaining buildings on site, SBG3 and SBG4, were also powered down, even though they were not directly affected by the fire.

                The shutdown of multiple data centers resulted in widespread service interruptions for thousands of customers, affecting websites, online services, databases, and virtual machines hosted in the affected region. OVHcloud's founder, Octave Klaba, used Twitter and the company's status page to provide real-time updates, confirming that the fire was not related to a cyberattack or external interference. Instead, the company focused on containing the physical damage and assessing the operational impact, while customers began reporting inaccessible services, missing backups, and broken applications.

                In the days following the incident, OVHcloud initiated large-scale recovery efforts, but the loss of SBG2 meant that some hosted data was permanently destroyed, especially for customers who did not enable off-site or external backups. Although partial services were gradually restored, the full recovery process took weeks, and many businesses were forced to migrate workloads or rebuild systems from scratch. The scale of the outage highlighted how a single physical point of failure in cloud infrastructure—especially when not fully redundant—can lead to long-lasting consequences far beyond a single location.
