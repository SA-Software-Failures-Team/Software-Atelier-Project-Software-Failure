            <h1>Future Prevention Strategies</h1>
            <p>
               The OVHcloud fire brought to the forefront that today's data centers need to implement additional physical resiliency to complement traditional cybersecurity. One of the most immediate takeaways is investment in automatic fire suppression systems and compartmentalization of server rooms. Without such systems, SBG2 relied on manual intervention, allowing the fire to spread freely. For the future, providers will have to consider physical disaster prevention in the same light as network security, deploying automated protections for hardware, power, and environmental controls.

                From an architectural point of view, the outage underscored that true geographical redundancy is needed-not just on-site backups. But to many customers impacted, data "in the cloud" should mean safe; the loss of complete production systems put an end to that notion. Cloud designs in the future need to ensure multi-region replication, hybrid or multi-cloud deployments, and policies of "backup-as-a-default" rather than optional add-ons. Cloud providers are also expected to give customers a more precise idea of where their data is stored and if they are protected against single-site failure.

                Finally, the fire shifted industry expectations around transparency and responsibility in cloud hosting: customers now expect explicit communication of backup policies, clearer service-level agreements regarding disaster recovery, and real-time status reporting in case of critical events. That made it plain to see that resilience is not just a technical feature but rather a trust issue. As cloud infrastructures grow larger and more deeply integrated with national and business operations, prevention strategies need to evolve from being reactive measures to built-in, verifiable guarantees of continuity.
