                <h2>OVHcloud Data Center Fire - France, 2021</h2>
                <p>
                    On 10 March 2021, a fire broke out inside the SBG2 data center at OVHcloud's Strasbourg site in France. The blaze completely destroyed the SBG2 facility and partially damaged several rooms in the neighboring SBG1 building. Although the nearby SBG3 and SBG4 data centers were not physically affected, they were shut down as a precaution, leading to a lengthy restart process and widespread service disruption.
