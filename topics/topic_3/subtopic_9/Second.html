            <h1>More Data About: Traffic volume</h1>
            <p>
            This graph shows the internet traffic on October 4, 2021, during the outage, of Facebook's main services, so not only Facebook, but also Facebook Video, Instagram and WhatsApp. 
            Each area represents the average traffic in bits per second over time.
            From the early morning until around 16:00 UTC, traffic gradually increased as people used these services. However, at about 16:00 UTC, there was a sudden and complete drop in traffic across all Facebook platforms indicating the start of the global outage.
            We can see clearly that the outage lasted for roughly 5.5 hours, during which the traffic remained near zero. After around 21:30 UTC, traffic began to rise again as the services were gradually restored and the users were reconnected.
