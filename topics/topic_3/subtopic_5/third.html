            <br>
            <p id="first">
                The global impact of the Knight Capital bug was a seismic event that sent shockwaves well beyond the firm's own $440 million internal loss. 
                Its most immediate effect was a direct and public assault on market integrity. 
                For 45 minutes, a single rogue algorithm unleashed a torrent of millions of phantom orders, creating a "digital storm" that artificially warped the prices of over 150 different stocks. 
                The system single-handedly generated impossible trading volumes, at times accounting for more than half the market's activity in specific stocks. 
                This demonstrated to the world, in real-time, that the entire U.S. market was alarmingly vulnerable to a single, catastrophic technical failure.

            <p id="second">
                This spectacle of an uncontrolled machine hijacking the market triggered a profound crisis of confidence. 
                For the public and institutional investors alike, it was a terrifying validation of their worst fears about high-speed, "black box" trading. 
                It exposed the fact that the financial system was critically reliant on complex, opaque technology that even its creators could not always control, 
                shattering the trust in the market's fundamental fairness and stability.

            <p id="third">
                This loss of faith had an immediate and fatal consequence for Knight Capital itself. 
                The firm, once the largest trader in U.S. equities, was exposed as the source of the chaos. 
                Its clients and partners fled, and its own stock plummeted by 75% in a matter of hours. 
                Knight was driven to the verge of insolvency, surviving only through an emergency bailout from a consortium of its rivals—a rescue that permanently erased its independence. 
                This spectacular and rapid implosion served as a stark, global symbol of the immense systemic risks lurking beneath the surface of modern automated finance.
