            <h1>Root Cause: Design, Business, and Regulatory Flaws</h1>
            <p>
                Design Flaw in MCAS: The MCAS was introduced to make the 737 MAX, with its larger, re-positioned engines, handle similarly to previous 737 models. Crucially, the final MCAS design used input from only one of the aircraft's two AoA sensors. This created a single point of failure: a malfunction in just one sensor could lead to the system's erroneous activation with no cross-check from the second sensor. Furthermore, the system was given excessive authority to move the stabilizer and could repeat its inputs.

            <p>
                Business Pressure and Non-Disclosure: Boeing's decision to update the 737 platform, rather than build an all-new jet, was driven by the need to compete with the Airbus A320neo and allow airlines to transition pilots with minimal extra training (avoiding costly simulator training and a full aircraft recertification). To achieve this, Boeing initially failed to disclose the existence of the MCAS to pilots in flight manuals, judging its operation to be transparent and background-only.

            <p>
                Regulatory Oversight Shortcomings: The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) delegated a significant portion of the certification work for the 737 MAX to Boeing employees, a process known as Organization Designation Authorization (ODA). This lack of rigorous, independent scrutiny over the new, critical flight control system design was a key enabler of the flawed design being approved.
