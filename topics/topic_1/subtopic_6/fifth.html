                The revised MCAS software now receives input from both AoA sensors, will only activate once, and has a significantly reduced ability to command the nose down. An Angle of Attack Disagree light and an AoA Indicator, previously optional or non-functional, are now standard.

                Pilots now receive mandated, rigorous simulator-based training that includes responding to an MCAS malfunction scenario, ensuring proficiency in disabling the runaway trim system.

                The FAA and international regulators implemented reforms to increase direct oversight of design and certification, reducing reliance on delegated manufacturer authority, particularly for flight-critical software. There is a push for greater international harmonization of certification standards.

                Boeing has faced pressure to restore its engineering-first culture, though recent incidents like the 2024 Alaska Airlines door plug blowout suggest challenges in production quality remain. The long-term outlook depends on a sustained commitment to prioritizing safety and transparency over financial shortcuts. The aviation industry is now under intense scrutiny to ensure that human lives remain the absolute priority in the development of increasingly complex, software-driven aircraft.
