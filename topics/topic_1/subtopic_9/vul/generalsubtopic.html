        <h2>Introduction: Old Code in a New Battlefield</h2>
        <p>This research investigates a different kind of software failure: the inherent vulnerabilities of legacy systems, using the F-15 and F-16 as case studies. Designed in the 1970s, these aircraft were built for an analog world, lacking the fundamental security architecture to defend against modern digital threats. This analysis explores the root <strong>design flaw</strong> of their databus, the <strong>modern attack vectors</strong> that exploit it, and the immense practical <strong>challenge of "patching"</strong> flight-critical legacy hardware.</p>
