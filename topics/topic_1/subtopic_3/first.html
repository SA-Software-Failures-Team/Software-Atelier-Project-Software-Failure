                The Mars Polar Lander (MPL) was a robotic lander launched by NASA on January 3, 1999, as part of its "faster, better, cheaper" Mars '98 program. Its primary mission was to study the soil and climate of Planum Australe, a region near the south pole of Mars. It was a high-stakes mission, as it was designed to be the first spacecraft to land in a Martian polar region and search for water ice.

                The lander was scheduled to touch down on December 3, 1999. The final stage of its journey was the critical Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) phase. This complex, autonomous sequence involved deploying a heat shield, a parachute, and finally, using a set of 12 "pulse" descent engines to control its final drop to the surface. The entire process was pre-programmed, as the 10-minute light-speed delay made real-time control from Earth impossible.

            <p id="third">
                As the lander entered the Martian atmosphere, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) received a final, stable radio signal, confirming the EDL sequence had begun. Per the mission plan, the lander would then go silent to focus all its resources on landing, and was expected to re-establish contact with Earth shortly after touching down. That signal never came. Mission controllers waited, but the lander remained silent. After repeated attempts to hail the spacecraft failed, NASA declared the $165 million mission a complete loss on December 5, 1999.
