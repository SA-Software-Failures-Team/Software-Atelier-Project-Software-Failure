                <h2>Mars Polar Lander (1999)</h2>
                <p>
                    In December 1999, NASA lost the $165 million Mars Polar Lander spacecraft just as it began its final descent to the Martian surface. The subsequent investigation pointed to a catastrophic software bug as the most probable cause. The lander's software was designed to shut off the descent engines upon sensing touchdown. However, the physical "jiggle" from the landing legs unfolding during descent was enough to falsely trigger the delicate sensors, fooling the software into thinking it had already landed. The lander prematurely shut down its engines while still 40 meters above the surface, resulting in a fatal free-fall and impact.
