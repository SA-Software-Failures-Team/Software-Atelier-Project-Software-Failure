                <h2>Mars Climate Orbiter (1998)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mars Climate Orbiter was a robotic space probe launched by NASA on December 11, 1998, as part of the Mars Surveyor '98 program. 
                    Its primary mission was twofold: to study the Martian climate, atmosphere, and surface, and to serve as a communications relay for the Mars Polar Lander. 
                    After a nine-month journey to Mars, the spacecraft reached the planet on September 23, 1999. 
                    It fired its main engines to begin its orbital insertion, but after passing behind the planet, it failed to re-establish contact. 
                    Communication was permanently lost, and the probe was declared destroyed, ending the $125 million mission.
