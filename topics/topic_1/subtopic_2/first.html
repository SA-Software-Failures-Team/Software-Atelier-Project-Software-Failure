            <h1>A Weather Satellite for Mars: The Orbiter's Mission</h1>
            <br>
            <p id="first">
                The Mars Climate Orbiter had a clear and vital scientific purpose: to be the first dedicated weather satellite for another planet. Its primary mission was to conduct a detailed, systematic study of the Martian climate and atmosphere for one full Martian year, which is equivalent to 687 Earth days. 
                Scientists hoped to gain a comprehensive understanding of the planet's seasonal cycles. This included monitoring daily weather patterns, mapping the distribution of water vapor and dust suspended in the atmosphere, and recording precise temperature profiles at different altitudes. 
                By observing these elements over a complete year, the mission aimed to understand how the climate was currently behaving and to find new evidence for how it might have changed over the planet's history.

                To achieve these ambitious goals, the orbiter was equipped with a sophisticated pair of instruments. The main instrument was the Pressure Modulated Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR). 
                This advanced tool was designed to measure temperature, water vapor, and dust content by analyzing the infrared light (heat) given off by the atmosphere. 
                It would have provided a 3D map of the atmosphere's structure. Complementing the PMIRR was the Mars Climate Orbiter Color Imager (MARCI), a powerful camera system. MARCI was designed to take daily, wide-angle photos of the planet's surface and atmosphere in both visible and ultraviolet light. 
                This would give scientists a global view of weather patterns, allowing them to track the formation of dust storms, observe the seasonal shrinking and growing of the polar ice caps, and study the behavior of clouds.

            <p id="third">
                Beyond its role as a climate scientist, the orbiter had a second, equally critical function: it was designed to be the primary communications relay for its sister mission, the Mars Polar Lander. 
                The lander was scheduled to arrive on Mars just a few months later and was set to explore the planet's south polar region. Because the lander was on the surface, it would have been unable to communicate directly with Earth for long periods. 
                The Mars Climate Orbiter was supposed to circle above, acting as a "phone operator" in space, receiving scientific data from the lander and relaying it back to mission control on Earth. 
                This relay role was essential for the lander's success, and the loss of the orbiter not only destroyed its own mission but also severely jeopardized the upcoming lander mission (which ultimately failed as well).
