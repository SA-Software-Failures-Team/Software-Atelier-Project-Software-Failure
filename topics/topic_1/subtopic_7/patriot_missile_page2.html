            The Patriot system tracked time in tenths of a second using a 24-bit fixed-point register.
            The radar miscalculated the position of an approaching missile by more than 500 meters after 100 hours of continuous operation due to a minor rounding error.

                Timeline of the Failure:
                <ul>
                    <li>Day 0: The Patriot system began to run constantly in Dhahran.</li>
                    <li> Hour 100: Radar got imprecise due to cumulative rounding mistake.</li>
                    <li>February 25, 1991: Incoming Scud missile not intercepted.</li>
                    <li>Immediate Result: 28 killed, 100+ injured.</li>
                    <li>Aftermath: A software patch was used to regularly reset the timer.</li>
                </ul>

            Lessons Learned / Prevention:
            - Always take long-term accuracy into account while developing essential software.<br>
            - Incorporate system resets on a regular basis to prevent accumulating mistakes.<br>
            - Extensive testing in real-world operational environments is essential.<br>
            - Even small rounding errors can have catastrophic consequences.
