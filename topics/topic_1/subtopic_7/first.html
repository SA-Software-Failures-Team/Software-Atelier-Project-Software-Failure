            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                Incoming missiles can be detected, tracked, and intercepted by the Patriot Missile Defense System. During the Gulf War, it was widely employed.
                But in 1991, a catastrophic breakdown resulted from a significant software vulnerability.

            <h2>The Failure</h2>
            <p>
                On February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile attacked a U.S. 
                Army barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 troops and wounded around 100 others when a Patriot missile battery failed to stop it. 
                A software bug in the internal clock of the machine was the reason.

            <h2>Cause of the Vulnerability</h2>
            <p>
                The system measured time in decimals from startup. After nearly 100 hours of continuous operation,
                a rounding error appeared in the calculation of time, causing the radar to miscalculate the
                missile's position by more than half a kilometer. As a result, the system completely lost track of
                the incoming missile.
