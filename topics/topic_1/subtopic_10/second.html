            <h1>Technical Breakdown: The Uconnect Flaw</h1>
            <p>
                The primary vulnerability was a glaring flaw in the vehicle's "telematics" system—the Uconnect infotainment unit. These systems, which controlled the radio, navigation, and climate, were connected to the internet via a built-in Sprint cellular connection. This internet-facing component was the attackers' entry point.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek discovered that a software service on the Uconnect system, known as D-Bus (Desktop Bus), was listening for commands on a specific, open port (port 6667). This port was not firewalled from the cellular network, meaning anyone who scanned the Sprint network for vulnerable IP addresses could find it. There was no authentication required to send commands to this service.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This oversight was critical, but the truly catastrophic flaw was the car's network architecture. The Uconnect system was not isolated from the car's essential internal network, the **Controller Area Network (CAN bus)**. The CAN bus is the vehicle's central nervous system, connecting critical components like the engine, brakes, steering, and transmission. The attackers were able to use their access to the infotainment system to "pivot" and inject malicious commands directly onto the CAN bus.
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve this, they first gained root access on the infotainment system. Then, they reflashed the firmware of a secondary chip (the V820) that *was* connected to the CAN bus. This re-flashed chip would now accept their commands from the head unit and broadcast them to the rest of the car. Because the CAN bus protocol at the time had no security or message verification, the car's components (like the brakes or transmission) simply accepted these malicious commands as legitimate.
            </p>
