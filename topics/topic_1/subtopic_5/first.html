            <p>
                The F22 Raptor is an advanced stealth fighter aircraft.
                During early operational testing, a software bug in its flight control system was discovered,
                which could potentially cause control issues in certain edge-case scenarios.

            <h2>The Bug</h2>
            <p>
                The bug involved the flight control algorithms misinterpreting sensor data under specific conditions.
                It did not cause any known crashes, but it required immediate correction to ensure safe operation.

            <h2>Impact and Prevention</h2>
            <p>
                The bug led to a temporary suspension of some test flights. 
                Developers patched the software, added more rigorous simulation checks, 
                and implemented long-term monitoring to prevent recurrence.
