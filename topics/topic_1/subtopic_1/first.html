            <p id="first">
                The maiden flight of the Ariane 5 rocket, Flight 501, commenced successfully from the Kourou launch site on June 4, 1996, marking the highly anticipated debut of Europe's new heavy-lift launch vehicle. The ascent was nominal until approximately 37 seconds after lift-off (T+37 seconds). At this critical moment, the rocket's guidance unit, the Inertial Reference System (IRS), suffered a complete software failure. This failure was triggered by an unhandled software exception within the active IRS module, which caused it to shut down immediately.

            <p id="second">
                The failure was compounded by the design's lack of diversity: the identical backup IRS module failed simultaneously for the exact same reason, leaving the Ariane 5 without any reliable attitude or guidance information. The onboard computer (OBC) then received this catastrophic error data from the failed IRS units. Critically, the OBC misinterpreted this diagnostic information, reading it as valid flight data that demanded an extreme, immediate course correction.

            <p id="third">
                Based on this misinterpreted data, the OBC issued a fatal command, causing the engines' nozzles to swivel to their extreme position. This drastic, unwarranted maneuver caused the rocket to veer sharply off course. The immense and sudden excessive aerodynamic forces generated by this maneuver quickly overwhelmed the rocket's structure, tearing the solid rocket boosters away from the main stage. The irreversible breakup of the vehicle was detected by the flight termination system, which then automatically triggered the self-destruct mechanism, resulting in the explosion of the Ariane 5 and its four valuable scientific satellites at an altitude of about four kilometers.
