            <h1>Root Cause: Software Reuse and System Engineering Flaws</h1>
            <p>
                The core issue behind the Ariane 5 disaster was a failure in system-level analysis stemming from the reuse of legacy code, leading to an unhandled software exception. The technical trigger was an arithmetic overflow within an alignment function in the Inertial Reference System (IRS). Specifically, the software attempted to convert a 64-bit floating-point number, which represented the rocket's horizontal velocity component (known as the "Horizontal Bias"), into a much smaller 16-bit signed integer. This specific piece of code, inherited from the older Ariane 4 rocket, never caused an issue previously because the Ariane 4's flight path and lower velocity ensured the value never exceeded the 16-bit integer's maximum capacity (approximately 32,767).
            <br>
            <p>
                However, the Ariane 5's new, more powerful boosters and different flight trajectory generated significantly higher horizontal velocity values in the initial seconds of flight, which instantly exceeded the 16-bit limit. This overflow caused the unhandled software exception, leading directly to the processors shutting down. Compounding this technical flaw was the presence of unnecessary code: the alignment function containing the problematic conversion was only required before lift-off and served no function during the flight phase. It was left running for a defined period based on an outdated Ariane 4 requirement, demonstrating a critical failure to evaluate and prune "dead code" for the new vehicle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Ultimately, two profound system engineering flaws turned the bug into a catastrophe. Firstly, the design suffered from a critical lack of diversity: the backup IRS module was an exact clone running the identical software, guaranteeing it would fail in the exact same manner just 72 milliseconds after the primary unit. Secondly, the inadequate exception handling proved fatal; the software's default response to the unhandled arithmetic overflow was a processor shutdown. This catastrophic failure mode, rather than a controlled, graceful degradation, eliminated all guidance and attitude information, directly leading to the rocket's self-destruction.
