                <h2>The Day the Skies Stood Still: The FAA NOTAM Outage (2023)</h2>
                <p>
                    On January 11, 2023, the U.S. aviation system was brought to a halt by the failure of the NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) system. This critical infrastructure, which provides essential safety notices to pilots, crashed overnight. 
                    The FAA was forced to issue a nationwide "ground stop," halting all domestic flight departures for the first time since 9/11. The failure, which caused thousands of delays and cancellations, wasn't a cyberattack, but was ultimately traced back to a single corrupted file in an antiquated, 30-year-old system.
