        <h2>Part 2: Operational Flight Program (OFP) Bugs</h2>
        <p>If ALIS represented the logistical failure, the <strong>Operational Flight Program (OFP)</strong>—the 8 million lines of code running inside the jet's processors—represents the immediate, life-threatening failure. The F-35 is less a "plane" and more a "flying sensor package." Its entire advantage comes from software. When that software fails, the pilot is left flying one of the most expensive bricks in the world.</p>
        <p>Early OFP versions were notoriously unstable, leading to critical "Priority 1" bugs that could directly result in mission failure or loss of life.</p>

        <h2>Sensor Fusion: The "Digital Fog of War"</h2>
        <p>The F-35's core promise is "sensor fusion." It is designed to take data from its radar, infrared camera (EOTS), and 360-degree Distributed Aperture System (DAS) and "fuse" it into one simple, god-like view of the battlefield for the pilot. When this works, it's revolutionary. When it bugs out, it's catastrophic.</p>
        <p>Pilots reported critical software bugs that undermined this very concept:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crashing Systems:</strong> Pilots experienced their radar and other sensors simply "blinking out" mid-flight, forcing a complete system reboot while in potentially hostile airspace.</li>
            <li><strong>Ghost Targets:</strong> The fusion software would incorrectly process data, creating "ghost" or "phantom" tracks—showing enemy aircraft that weren't there, or multiple tracks for a single friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeting Errors:</strong> Bugs were found that caused the system to be unable to correctly identify or track targets, or would swap target data between planes in a formation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Helmet: A $400,000 Point of Failure</h2>
        <p>The F-35 has no traditional "Head-Up Display" (HUD). Instead, all critical flight and targeting data is projected onto the visor of the pilot's $400,000 helmet. This makes the helmet's software a single point of failure.</p>
        <p>Pilots reported severe software-driven issues, including a "green glow" on the visor that obscured vision at night (especially when landing on an aircraft carrier), display lag that could cause motion sickness, and a total "blue screen" effect when the system crashed.</p>

        <h2>Weapon System Failures</h2>
        <p>Even the jet's ability to fight has been hampered by code. Persistent bugs in the software for the 25mm cannon in the F-35A model made it inaccurate. Other bugs have been reported to prevent the correct release or targeting of air-to-air missiles, rendering the jet defenseless and toothless.</p>
