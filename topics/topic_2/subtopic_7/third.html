               <b>Right before the attack</b>
               <br><br>
               23rd December 2015, this is the day the attackers
               found the VPN keys. With these keys they could access
               the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
               systems. This meant that the attackers had remote access
               to the power grids, and there was no going back from here.
               There was no need for hiding anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>The attack</b>
               <br><br>
               The attackers started sending commands to turn power grids
               off. 30 stations lost electricity and 230,000 people
               were left in the dark. 
               <br><br>
               While this was happening, the attackers did a TdoS attack.
               This meant that the call centres of the power companies were
               spammed with fake calls. This made it impossible for real people
               to communicate with the company, stopping the companies from knowing
               the scale of this attack.






               <br><br>
               After this, the KillDisk malware was dropped.
