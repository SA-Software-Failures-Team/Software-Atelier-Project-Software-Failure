            <h2>Vulnerability: The 2015 Ukraine Power Grid Hack</h2>
            <p>On December 23rd, 2015, there was a power outage in parts of Ukraine. In the freezing winter, around 230,000 people lost access to electricity, this meant that these people would not be able to cook food, turn on lamps, and most importantly, these people would not be able to heat their houses with electric heaters, which was the most common way to heat houses at that time. 
<br><br>
The cyber attack exploited vulnerabilities not only in the power grid's software systems, but also in corruption in the government's regulations. The timing of this attack was also very strategical as it was very close to the Christmas holiday which meant a lot of people were not working, meaning it was less likely that the malware could be detected before the attack.
<br><br>
These power grids were not made by Ukraine itself, but by the Soviet Union and were upgraded using Russian technology. This meant that the vulnerabilities and workings of these power grids were not confidential, and accessible by anyone who had access to the said Russian technology and USSR Power Grids. 
<br><br>
The question now, is what exactly happened? 
<br><br>
A group of hackers ( assumed to be from Russia from tracing IP addresses) used a malware called “BlackEnergy3” to cause a cyber attack in 3 main power companies in Ukraine causing power outage that lasted around 6 hours.
<br><br>
The next pages cover the details of this attack.
