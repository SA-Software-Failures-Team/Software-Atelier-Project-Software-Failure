          <h1>The aftermath of the attack</h1>
           <p>
               The KillDisk is another malware used by the
               attackers. This malware did not have any advantages
               for the attackers, instead it wiped out the systems.
               This covered the tracks of the attackers, but more importantly,
               it made it more difficult for the authorities to restore power.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               This was a sabotage attempt to shower power in the expense of people.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               <b>Recovery</b>
               <br><br>
               As a result of the KillDisk malware, the recovery was manual.
               Authority had to drive from one power station to another. This took
               hours and created chaos. This may have been the plan for the attackers all along.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Aftermath</b>
               <br><br>
           The cyberattack caused a lot of damage. Not only did people
           have to survive without power in the winter cold, but more
           importantly, people got something to be scared of. The reign of
           cyber warfare started.
               <br><br>
           This type of warfare is not entirely about hackers and malware,
           but also a psychological warfare. The biggest Vulnerability that
           was exploited was the humanity and fear.
