          <h1>The attack: Steps before the attack</h1>
           <p>
               The overview showed us the immediate effects of the attack,
               however something that we may not have known is the planning
               and procedures that went behind this attack.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               It would be safe to say that this attack was a well planned
               attack that started months before the execution on 23rd December.
           </p>
           <br>
           <p>
               <b>Spear Phishing</b>
               <br><br>
               The employees at these companies were sent false emails posing
               to be officials from the government. These emails contained
               Microsoft Word documents which contained the BlackEnergy3 malware.
               A Trojan horse.  This malware gave the hackers access to the employees'
               systems.
           </p>
           <p>
               <b>Credentials theft</b>
               <br><br>
               The hackers now had access to the credentials of the employees. This
               meant that they could access confidential files. One of the most
               important files that the attackers were looking for was the VPN keys.
               These keys would make it possible for the attackers to access the
               Operation Technology network, from which they could control the power grids.
               <br><br>
               While this was happening, the company and government officials were not aware of any threat.
