            <h1>Bug vs Vulnerability</h1>
            <p>
                On a final look at the shut-down, was it actually just a bug or a vulnerability that was exploited
                intentionally or unintentionally?
                In my opinion, the answer is that it was both, but the bug is what triggered the shutdown.
                <br><br>
                <b>Vulnerability:</b>
                <br>
                The lack of a firewall was a vulnerability, that was somehow exploited, allowing the bug to exist in the
                operation network.
                <br><br>
                <b>Bug:</b>
                <br>
                The software update was a bug. This bug could travel to the operation network to cause the reset and
                reboot because of the vulnerability.
                <br><br>
                <b>Conclusion: </b>
                <br>The bad design, a vulnerability allowed the problem to occur, but the software bug was the
                cause of the shutdown.
