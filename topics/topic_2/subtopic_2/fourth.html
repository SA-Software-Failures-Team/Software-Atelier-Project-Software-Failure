            <h1>Bug vs Vulnerability</h1>
            <p>
                On a final look at the shut-down, was it actually just a bug or a vulnerability that was exploited
                intentionally or unintentionally?
                <br><br>
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, the answer is that it was both, but the bug is what triggered the shutdown.
                <br><br>
                <b>Vulnerability:</b>
                <br><br>
                The lack of a firewall was a vulnerability, that was somehow exploited, allowing the bug to exist in the
                operation network.
                <br><br>
                <b>Bug:</b>
                <br><br>
                The software update was a bug. This bug could travel to the operation network to cause the reset and
                reboot because of the vulnerability.
                <br><br>
                Conclusion: The bad design, a vulnerability allowed the problem to occur, but the software bug was the
                cause of the shutdown.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Aftermath</b>
                <br><br>
                The cyberattack caused a lot of damage. Not only did people
                have to survive without power in the winter cold, but more
                importantly, people got something to be scared of. The reign of
                cyber warfare started.
                <br><br>
                This type of warfare is not entirely about hackers and malware,
                but also a psychological warfare. The biggest Vulnerability that
                was exploited was the humanity and fear.
