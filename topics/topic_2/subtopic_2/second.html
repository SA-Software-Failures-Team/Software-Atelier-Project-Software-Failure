            <h1>What happened?</h1>
            <p>
                The first question that comes to our mind when we think of this event is “How did it happen?
                <br><br>
                It could not have happened on it’s own, and that was not the plant’s first software update.
                <br><br>
                Lets take a look at what happened.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The software update was for the business side of the plant.
                This is why this update had no fail-safe.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This time, however, the network through which the update was supposed to travel, the corporate network,
                was not separated from the network of computers and systems which controlled the nuclear power-plant.
                <br><br>
                Somehow, the software update “leaked” from the corporate network to the operational network.
                <br><br>
                This caused the systems in the operational network to reset and reboot. This is how the software updates
                are implemented in the systems.
                <br><br>
                After the update, the safety protocols in the network did not detect a fail-safe for which, it caused an
                automatic shutdown
