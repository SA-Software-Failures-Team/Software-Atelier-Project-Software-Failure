            <h2>Hatch Nuclear Plant: An Accidental Bug</h2>
            <p>On March 7, 2008, the Unit 2 of the Hatch Nuclear Plant in Georgia shut down for 48 hours. This caused a
                lot of panic, as the world knows what happened the last time a nuclear plant shut down: Chernobyl.
                <br><br>
                The first thought again, was an outside attack. China or Russia perhaps. But this was not the case.
                Again, the problem was not from the outside, but a mistake, inside. A bug.
                <br><br>
                Precisely, a software update.
                <br><br>
                This update packet travelled to a critical computer in the control network, causing a reboot, causing a
                loss of data in the “fail-safe”. Triggering a shutdown of the whole nuclear plant. It is very
                interesting to think that a software-update which is made to improve a software can cause a national
                panic.
                This is the classic example of a software failure caused by a bug.
                <br><br>
                Lets take a look at the whole event in details.
