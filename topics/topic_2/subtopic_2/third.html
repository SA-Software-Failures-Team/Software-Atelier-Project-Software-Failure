            <br>
            <p>
                As we saw in the previous part, the software update is a mistake. One that can happen to everyone.
                However, the main question is that this kind of mistake should not happen as “everyday” mistakes should
                be anticipates and avoided.
                <br><br>
                This meant authorities would have to not only check outside for threats, but also inside. As the easiest
                way for a cyber-attack in power-plants may have been to work for the power-plant.
                <br><br>
                A primary failure point, of this event, was the bad decision to allow the corporate networks and
                operative networks to coexist without proper boundaries.
                <br><br>
                This incident brought a bigger problem than just technical settings. A small bug causing a whole plant
                to shut-down, means that the whole system is not properly working. This means every single employee on
                the power-plant have a lot of power.. Anyone with access, has the ability to cause a lot of damage,
                accidentally or on purpose.
