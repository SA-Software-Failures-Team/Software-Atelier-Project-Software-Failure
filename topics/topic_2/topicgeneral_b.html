                    In this section we will analyze what a bug, as innocent as it can be, can cause failures in infrastructure, governemental projects and country-wide scale. A bug can be interpreted as a simple error in the code itself, it could a data conversion error, it could be that the wrong constant has been used (inches or cm for example). We will see why and how these bugs happened and how intuitively disaster could have been avoided. It is important to note that a statement such as "the code is good enough" is a recipe for failure, very costly and possibly life threatening.
