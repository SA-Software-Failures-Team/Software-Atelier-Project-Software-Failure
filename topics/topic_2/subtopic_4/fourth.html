            <p id="first">
                Once multiple 345-kV lines in Ohio were lost, loading on parallel paths surged. Voltages dipped,
                reactive reserves thinned, and large power swings developed across regional interfaces. In minutes,
                additional transmission lines and generators tripped. Islands formed: some with generation shortfalls
                (frequency dropped), others with excess generation (frequency rose). Automatic under-frequency and
                 under-voltage load shedding operated, but the disturbance’s breadth exceeded local defenses.

            <p id="second">
                The human impact was immediate and tangible. New York City, Detroit, Cleveland, Toronto, and many
                smaller communities lost power. Subways and commuter rail halted; traffic signals failed; water pumping
                and treatment systems struggled; cellular networks and broadcasting faced backup-power limits. Economic
                disruption rippled through finance, manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. Estimates placed total losses
                in the multi-billion-dollar range, and Canada alone recorded tens of millions of lost work hours.

            <p id="third">
                Recovery required methodical grid restoration. Operators black-started key stations, synchronized islands,
                and restored transmission paths before reconnecting customer load. The process demanded tight
                cross-border coordination, conservative operating limits, and constant monitoring of frequency and voltage.
                Many customers returned the same day; others waited several days as crews verified equipment integrity and
                re-established stable power flows across the interconnection.
