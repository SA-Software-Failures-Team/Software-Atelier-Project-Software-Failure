            <h1>How &amp; Why the System Failed</h1>
            <p>
                From early tests, the system showed serious problems: bags were misread, misrouted,
                thrown off carts, jammed in tracks, or arrived crushed and open. Timing between
                conveyors, switches and carts was extremely tight, and even small delays caused chain
                reactions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The airport opening was delayed by many months mainly because the automated system
                simply did not work reliably. While engineers tried to fix issues, costs grew, and the
                city eventually built backup conventional systems. In the end, only a reduced version
                of the automation was used for a limited area and a single airline.

            <p>
                Reasons for failure included:
                <br>
                – Over-ambitious scope: one huge integrated system for all baggage<br>
                – Novel technology at an unprecedented scale<br>
                – Inadequate testing of the full end-to-end system<br>
                – Last-minute design changes and unrealistic deadlines
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Denver case shows that a complex cyber-physical system can collapse if design,
                software, hardware and operations are not aligned from the start.
