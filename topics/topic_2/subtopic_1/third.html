                    <strong>Software Complexity</strong><br>
                    The control software had to coordinate thousands of carts, switches and scanners in
                    real time. The system was highly coupled: a small timing bug could break an entire
                    route. Full-scale integration tests were limited, so many defects appeared only
                    when the whole airport was connected. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

                        <strong>Changing Requirements</strong><br>
                        Airlines and airport management requested changes even after design started:
                        new destinations for bags, modified layouts, different operating rules.
                        Instead of adjusting scope and schedule, changes were forced into an already
                        fragile design, increasing risk.

                    <strong>Lack of Realistic Testing &amp; Governance</strong><br>
                    The project ran on fixed deadlines and political pressure. There was little time
                    for gradual rollout, simulation or proper fallback strategies. Responsibilities
                    between city, contractors and airlines were blurred. This combination of technical
                    debt and weak management turned a promising idea into a famous failure.
