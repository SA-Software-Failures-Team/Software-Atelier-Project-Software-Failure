                <h2>Denver International Airport Automated Baggage System (1995)</h2>
                <p>
                    When Denver International Airport opened in 1995, it planned a fully automated,
                    airport-wide baggage handling system: high-speed carts, miles of track, scanners,
                    sensors and central control software. It was meant to be a futuristic piece of
                    infrastructure that moved bags quickly and efficiently with minimal human work.
                    Instead, it became one of the most famous software–engineering and project
                    management failures in history—causing delays, huge extra costs and, in the end,
                    a partial abandonment of the original vision.
