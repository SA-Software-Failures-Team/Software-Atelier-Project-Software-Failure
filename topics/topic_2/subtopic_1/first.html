           <h2>What Was the Denver Automated Baggage System?</h2>
           <p>
               Denver International Airport (DIA) wanted a single, integrated, fully automated baggage
               system for all airlines and terminals. Instead of traditional conveyors and manual tugs,
               bags would travel in small, radio-controlled carts on miles of track, guided by scanners,
               sensors and central control software.
               <br><br>
               The design included:
               <br>
               – Tens of thousands of meters of conveyors and track<br>
               – Thousands of intelligent carts<br>
               – Bar-code scanners, electric eyes and sensors to track each bag<br>
               – Networked computers coordinating routes and timing
               <br><br>
               The goal was to create a high-speed, high-tech logistics infrastructure inside the airport:
               shorter connection times, fewer lost bags, and a “smart” airport image.
               <br><br>
               On paper, it was a showcase of advanced software, automation and infrastructure engineering.
               In practice, the level of complexity, tight deadlines and constant design changes made it
               extremely fragile.
