            <p id="first">
                <strong>Delays &amp; Costs</strong><br>
                Problems with the automated baggage system were a main reason DIA’s opening was delayed
                by many months, costing the city hundreds of millions of dollars to keep an empty airport
                ready and to redesign backup systems. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
            </p>
            <br>

            <p id="second">
                <strong>Reputation &amp; Partial Abandonment</strong><br>
                The system became a global example of “high-tech gone wrong”. In the end, only a reduced
                subset was used for a single concourse; most baggage handling switched to more traditional,
                simpler solutions. The original vision of a fully automated, integrated system was never
                achieved.

            <p id="third">
                <strong>Key Lessons for Critical Software Projects</strong><br>
                – Do not scale unproven technology to “heroic” size in one step.<br>
                – Use phased deployment and realistic testing on the real infrastructure.<br>
                – Keep scope, schedule and budget flexible when requirements change.<br>
                – Ensure clear responsibility for system engineering and risk management.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p id="fourth">
                The Denver baggage system failure shows that digital infrastructure is infrastructure:
                when core services (like baggage handling in a hub airport) depend on complex software,
                weak design and bad coordination can disrupt an entire transport system.
                It is a warning for any modern smart airport, smart port or smart grid project.
