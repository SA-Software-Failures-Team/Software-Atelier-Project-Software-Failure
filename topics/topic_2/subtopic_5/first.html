                <p>The sequence of failures began in early February 2021, when an Arctic cold front, known as Winter Storm Uri, swept across the central United States.In Texas, temperatures plummeted to levels rarely seen in decades. As residents turned up their heating systems, electricity demand surged beyond all expectations. ERCOT’s demand forecast had not anticipated such extreme conditions, assuming winter peaks would remain moderate.
                At the same time, dozens of power plants failed due to frozen sensors, valves, and pipelines. Both natural-gas and coal facilities suffered shutdowns as fuel lines froze and supply chains broke down. Even some wind turbines iced over. By February 15, nearly half of the state’s generation capacity was offline.
                At 1:50 a.m. that morning, ERCOT ordered emergency rolling blackouts to prevent a catastrophic system collapse. The grid’s frequency dropped dangerously low, to around 59.4 Hz, and engineers later confirmed that the system was less than five minutes away from total failure.Had it collapsed, restoring power could have taken weeks or even months.
                For several days, millions of Texans lived without heat, electricity, or running water. Hospitals ran on backup generators; supermarkets and water systems shut down. The combination of unprecedented demand and unprepared infrastructure transformed a regional storm into a statewide humanitarian crisis.
