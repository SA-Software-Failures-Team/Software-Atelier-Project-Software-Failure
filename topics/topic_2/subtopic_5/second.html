            <h1>Investigation</h1>
            <p>
                In the aftermath, investigations by ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), and federal agencies sought to understand how the grid’s safeguards failed. The findings revealed a chain of modeling errors, regulatory gaps, and market design flaws that amplified the disaster.
                ERCOT’s internal models had underestimated both the probability and scale of extreme cold weather events. The system’s “reserve margin”, the cushion of extra capacity expected to meet peak demand, proved inadequate. Planning models assumed that generators would remain available even under cold stress, ignoring past freeze-related outages in 1989 and 2011.
                The market design compounded the problem. Texas operates an “energy-only” market, which pays generators only for the electricity they produce, not for maintaining spare capacity or weather-proofing facilities. As a result, there was little financial incentive for companies to invest in winterization or reliability upgrades.

                Finally, a pricing algorithm error worsened the crisis. During the emergency, ERCOT maintained the maximum wholesale price of $9,000/MWh for nearly two days longer than necessary, resulting in an estimated $16 billion in overcharges.The state’s grid monitor later confirmed this was a manual oversight stemming from flawed operational logic in crisis management protocols.
                Collectively, the investigations concluded that the “bug” was not a single technical glitch, but a systemic failure, an overreliance on market efficiency and inadequate modeling of low-probability, high-impact events.
