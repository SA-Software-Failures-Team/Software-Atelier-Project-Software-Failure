            <h1>Solutions</h1>
            <p>
                In the months following the disaster, multiple reforms targeted the technical, operational, and market design flaws revealed by the crisis.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Mandatory Winterization:</b> New Texas laws now require both power plants and natural-gas infrastructure to implement cold-weather protections such as insulation, heat tracing, and freeze-resistant sensors, subject to inspections and fines for non-compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Improved Forecasting Models:</b> ERCOT overhauled its demand and generation models to incorporate extreme-weather scenarios and stress-testing for multi-day cold events. Forecasting tools were updated to integrate temperature-dependent fuel-supply variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Market Rule Changes:</b> Regulators reviewed ERCOT’s scarcity pricing mechanisms, ensuring that emergency price caps are correctly applied and removed. The new design seeks to reward generators who maintain capacity during crises rather than relying solely on energy sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Grid Communication and Interconnection:</b> Efforts began to strengthen coordination with the Southwest Power Pool and other U.S. grid regions, potentially allowing Texas limited import capacity during emergencies, though full interconnection remains politically contentious.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Consumer Protection Measures:</b> Lawmakers introduced stricter oversight for variable-rate energy plans and emergency billing, preventing the extreme price spikes that bankrupted smaller retail electricity providers in 2021.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                These solutions collectively mark a transition from market efficiency toward system resilience, acknowledging that a purely competitive electricity market is vulnerable without structural safeguards.
            </p>
