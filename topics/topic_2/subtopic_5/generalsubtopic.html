                <h2>Texas Power Grid Modeling Error</h2>
                <p>
                In <b> Febrary 2021</b>, the state of <b>Texas</b> faced one of the most severe power crises in modern U.S. history. 
                A record-breaking Arctic storm brought subfreezing temperatures that crippled the state’s energy infrastructure. 
                Behind the visible outages lay a deeper systemic problem, a <b> modeling and market design error by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)</b>, 
                the organization responsible for managing 90% of Texas’s electric load.
                ERCOT’s planning models <b>severly underestimated</b> winter electricity demand and <b>overestimated </b>the grid’s ability to perform under extreme cold. 
                As the storm intensified, multiple types of generation like natural gas, coal, wind, and even nuclear, went offline due to frozen equipment and fuel shortages.
                At the same time, demand for heat skyrocketed, pushing the grid beyond its limits.
                The crisis affected more than 4.5 million customers and came within minutes of a total grid collapse. 
                Economic losses reached an estimated <b>80 to 130 billion dollars</b> , while at least 240 people lost their lives. 
                The event revealed that the true failure was not only mechanical, but structural, the result of years of market and policy decisions that prioritized low cost over long-term resilience.
