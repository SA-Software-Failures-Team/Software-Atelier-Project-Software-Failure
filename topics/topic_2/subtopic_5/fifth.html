            <h2>Wrapup</h2>
            <p>
                The 2021 Texas power grid failure remains one of the most striking examples of how engineering, economics, and governance can collide with devastating consequences. 
                The real “bug” behind the crisis was not a single malfunctioning system but a long-standing belief that market efficiency alone could guarantee reliability. 
                When extreme cold tested that assumption, the entire structure of the Texas grid proved dangerously fragile. 
                The event taught several critical lessons. First, energy planners must incorporate extreme-event modeling into every reliability assessment, forecasting only for average conditions is no longer sufficient in an age of climate volatility. 
                Second, reliability must have economic value; energy markets must reward companies that invest in redundancy, maintenance, and weatherproofing rather than focusing solely on short-term profits. 
                The crisis also exposed the interdependence of infrastructure systems, as failures in natural gas supply cascaded into electricity shortages, demonstrating that power and fuel networks cannot be managed in isolation. 
                Equally important was the need for transparency and communication: clearer coordination between ERCOT, state authorities, and the public could have mitigated panic and improved emergency response. 
                Perhaps the most enduring lesson is that investing in resilience costs far less than recovering from catastrophe. The Texas blackout proved that neglecting risk modeling and crisis preparedness can transform predictable weather patterns into systemic disasters and that true energy security lies not in deregulation or efficiency alone, but in sustained commitment to reliability and foresight.
