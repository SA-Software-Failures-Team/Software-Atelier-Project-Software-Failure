            <h1>Software &amp; Control Systems on Deepwater Horizon</h1>
            <p>
                Deepwater Horizon was not just a floating structure; it was a cyber-physical system. Industrial control
                systems, real-time monitoring software and safety logic all worked together to manage a high-pressure
                deepwater well.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Dozens of sensors measured pressure, flow rate and mud returns. Their signals were processed and
                displayed on screens in the control room. Software alarms were supposed to warn operators when values
                moved into dangerous ranges.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The subsea blowout preventer (BOP) relied on electronic commands and programmed logic to activate
                shear rams and seal the well in an emergency. This control chain made software configuration and data
                visibility part of the core safety infrastructure.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When alarms are silenced, displays become confusing, or logic is not fully tested, the “digital shield”
                that should protect the rig becomes weak. Deepwater Horizon shows that software in energy systems must
                be treated as safety-critical, just like valves, steel and cement.
