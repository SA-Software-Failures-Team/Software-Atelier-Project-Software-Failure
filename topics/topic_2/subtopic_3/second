            <p>
                According to Microsoft’s post-incident review, the outage was triggered by a planned change to the
                Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN). During an update to the IP address of a core WAN router, an incorrect
                command caused that router to send messages to all other routers in the WAN. This forced them to
                recompute their adjacency and forwarding tables simultaneously. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While the routers were busy recomputing, they were temporarily unable to forward traffic correctly.
                The result was packet loss and timeouts between users and Microsoft 365, between Azure regions, and
                across ExpressRoute connections. Because this WAN underpins many services at once, the misconfiguration
                did not stay local: it disrupted connectivity for Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, Power Platform
                and Azure resources in parallel. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A key detail: the command used behaved differently on different network devices and had not been fully
                vetted for the specific router where it was executed. In a software-defined, highly automated environment,
                this shows how one unsafe network change in the control plane can destabilise a global cloud backbone.

                Technically, this is a configuration and change-management failure, not a capacity problem: the hardware
                was there, but the logic controlling it introduced a systemic fault. It underlines how critical robust
                testing, staged rollouts and strict safeguards are for core infrastructure commands.
