                    Investigations showed that several key alarms and safety notifications on Deepwater Horizon were
                    disabled or configured not to disturb operators. This reduced “alarm noise”, but also removed an
                    essential barrier that should have highlighted abnormal well conditions.

                        Under commercial and time pressure, the crew misinterpreted a critical negative pressure test.
                        The human–machine interface did not clearly distinguish safe from unsafe readings, and important
                        trends were hidden among other data. The software was available, but the way information was
                        presented and understood failed.

                    Behind the technical issues was a cultural problem: digital safety systems were treated as adjustable
                    conveniences instead of strict safeguards. Allowing muted alarms and unclear ownership over risk
                    created a fragile environment, where a chain of small decisions could lead to a catastrophic outcome.
