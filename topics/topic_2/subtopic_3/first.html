            <p id="first">
                In the early morning of 25 January 2023 (UTC), users worldwide began to experience problems accessing
                Microsoft 365 and Azure services. Teams calls failed to connect, Outlook and Exchange Online showed
                errors, SharePoint and OneDrive were slow or unreachable, and some Azure resources could not be reached.
                For many organisations, it looked like “the whole Microsoft cloud” was unstable at the same time.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p id="second">
                Microsoft quickly confirmed a “networking issue” affecting connectivity to multiple services. The impact
                was broad but temporary: most core services were significantly affected for around 60–90 minutes, with
                residual issues continuing for some customers for a bit longer while traffic was rebalanced and systems
                recovered.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p id="third">
                Even though the outage was relatively short, it exposed how deeply companies, schools, and public
                institutions rely on Microsoft’s cloud for everyday operations. One internal change inside Microsoft’s
                backbone network was enough to disrupt communication, collaboration and access to business-critical
                workloads on a global scale.
