           <h2>Deepwater Horizon: What Happened?</h2>
           <p>
               On 20 April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon semi-submersible drilling rig was completing work on the Macondo
               well in the Gulf of Mexico, a deepwater oil reservoir that was part of BP’s wider energy infrastructure.
               During the temporary abandonment phase, critical pressure tests were misinterpreted, and signs of an
               unstable well were ignored.
               <br><br>
               As control operations continued, hydrocarbons entered the wellbore and travelled up towards the rig.
               Gas reached the rig floor, ignited, and triggered powerful explosions and a large fire. Eleven workers
               were killed, and after burning for about two days, the rig sank.
               <br><br>
               The subsea blowout preventer (BOP), positioned on the seafloor to seal the well in emergencies, failed
               to fully close. Oil and gas then flowed freely into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days, releasing millions
               of barrels of oil.
               <br><br>
               What began as a technical and procedural failure on one platform quickly became a major energy, economic
               and environmental crisis, showing how dependent modern society is on the safe operation of complex
               offshore infrastructure.
