                The immediate consequences of the Colonial Pipeline attack were felt across the southeastern United States. During the shutdown, millions of drivers faced fuel shortages, thousands of gas stations ran dry, and prices rose sharply. 
                Governors in several states, including Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, declared states of emergency to manage distribution and transportation. Beyond the operational disruption, the attack became a national security concern. 
                The White House treated the incident as a threat to critical infrastructure and convened a rapid interagency response.Only days later, President Biden signed Executive Order 14028, which aimed to strengthen federal cybersecurity, improve supply chain transparency, and increase information sharing between private and public sectors.
                The attack also spurred new directives from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE), requiring energy operators to report cyber incidents and adhere to stricter protective measures.
                Globally, the Colonial Pipeline case became a wake-up call for energy and industrial sectors, illustrating how digital weaknesses in administrative systems can cascade into large-scale physical consequences.
