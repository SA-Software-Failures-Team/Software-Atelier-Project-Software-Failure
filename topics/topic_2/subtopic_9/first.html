            <h1>What Happened</h1>

            <p id="first">
                On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline’s IT staff noticed unusual activity on their internal systems.
                It quickly became clear that the company had fallen victim to a ransomware attack, files were encrypted, systems were locked, and a digital ransom note appeared demanding payment in cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p id="second">
                Fearing that the attack could spread from administrative IT systems to the operational technology (OT) that controlled the physical flow of fuel, Colonial made the decisive choice to shut down its entire pipeline.
                Though critical for containment, the shutdown immediately disrupted nearly 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supply.
                In the following days, between May 8 and May 10, fuel shortages began to appear across multiple southeastern states. 
                Long lines formed at gas stations, prices spiked, and local governments declared states of emergency. 
                Panic buying became widespread as the company raced to restore control and verify system safety.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p id="third">
                By May 12, pipeline operations began to restart in stages, and by May 13, full service was restored.
                A week later, Colonial’s CEO confirmed that the company had paid a ransom of 75 Bitcoin (around $4.4 million) to obtain the decryption key and recover faster.
                Between May 7 and May 13, a single cyber intrusion had evolved into a nationwide energy disruption, showing how digital attacks can trigger tangible, real-world crises.
