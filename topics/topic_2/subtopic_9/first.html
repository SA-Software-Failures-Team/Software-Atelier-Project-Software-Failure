    <h2>What Happened</h2>
    <p>
      On 7 May 2021, Colonial Pipeline discovered a ransomware infection on its IT network. 
      The company quickly halted all pipeline operations to prevent the malware from spreading to its operational systems. 
      The shutdown lasted several days, affecting fuel supplies across the East Coast. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack was carried out by the <strong>DarkSide</strong> ransomware group, known for its “ransomware-as-a-service” model. 
      Operations gradually resumed between May 12 and 13 after containment measures and system restoration began.
