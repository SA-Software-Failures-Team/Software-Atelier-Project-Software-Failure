        <h2>Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021)</h2>
        <p>
          On 7 May 2021, Colonial Pipeline, one of the largest fuel pipeline operators in the U.S., was hit by a ransomware attack. 
          The company shut down operations to contain the breach, disrupting nearly 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supply. 
          The cyberattack, linked to the DarkSide ransomware group, caused temporary shortages and panic buying across several states. 
          Colonial later paid approximately $4.4 million in Bitcoin, part of which was recovered by U.S. authorities.
