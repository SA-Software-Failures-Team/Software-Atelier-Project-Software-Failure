<h1>Timeline of the Oldsmar Water Treatment Attack</h1> 

<p>On February 5, 2021, an attacker gained unauthorized access to the Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility’s control system. The intrusion lasted for only a few minutes but was enough to manipulate the sodium hydroxide (lye) levels in the water supply, increasing them to potentially dangerous concentrations.</p> 
<br> 

<p>The attack began in the morning when the intruder accessed the facility remotely via TeamViewer, a remote desktop software. Fortunately, an operator noticed the unusual cursor movements on the SCADA interface and quickly regained control, preventing the chemical levels from being altered significantly.</p> 
<br> 

<p>Immediately after the attempted attack, the facility shut down remote access temporarily and began an internal investigation. Authorities, including the FBI and local cybersecurity teams, were notified. The incident demonstrated the speed and subtlety with which cyber intrusions can affect critical infrastructure.</p> 
<br> 

<p>This timeline highlights the importance of constant monitoring, rapid operator intervention, and incident response protocols. Even brief access to industrial control systems can have serious public health implications if undetected or unmitigated.</p>
