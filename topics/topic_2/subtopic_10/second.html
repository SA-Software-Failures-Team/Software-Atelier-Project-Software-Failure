<h1>The Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility</h1> 
<p> The Oldsmar Water Treatment Facility, located in Oldsmar, Florida, is responsible for treating and distributing clean water to thousands of residents. The facility uses industrial control systems (ICS) and SCADA software to manage water purification processes, including the precise dosing of chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and chlorine. </p> 
<br> 
<p> Operators remotely monitor water quality and chemical levels to ensure public safety. While these systems allow for efficient management, they also create potential entry points for cyber intrusions if not properly secured. Before the attack, remote access was permitted through standard protocols without multi-factor authentication, making it vulnerable to exploitation. </p> 
<br> 
<p> The facility’s personnel relied on automated monitoring and periodic manual checks to maintain safety. This highlights the importance of combining technological systems with rigorous security practices to protect critical infrastructure from potential cyber threats. Understanding the operational setup is essential to grasp how attackers were able to interfere with water treatment processes. </p>
