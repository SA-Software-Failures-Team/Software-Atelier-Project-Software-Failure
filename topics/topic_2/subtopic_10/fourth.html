<h1>Aftermath & Strengthening Water System Security</h1>
<p> Following the Oldsmar water treatment attack, both local authorities and federal agencies emphasized the importance of improving cybersecurity across all critical infrastructure. Immediate actions included tightening remote access controls, implementing multi-factor authentication, and increasing real-time monitoring of SCADA systems. </p>
<br>
<p> The incident triggered a nationwide review of water treatment facilities, highlighting the risk posed by even brief unauthorized intrusions. Training programs were enhanced for facility operators to recognize suspicious activity, and stricter regulations were proposed for industrial control systems in essential services. </p>
<br>
<p> This attack demonstrated that critical infrastructure is a high-value target for cyber threats. The lessons learned from Oldsmar stress the need for continuous auditing, improved incident response plans, and a proactive approach to cybersecurity in order to protect public health and safety. </p>
