                <div class="context-text">
                    <p>The WannaCry attack was a widespread ransomware cyberattack that occurred in May 2017. Ransomware
                        is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands
                        payment to restore access. If payment is not made before the deadline, the victim risks
                        permanent data loss.</p>

                    <p>WannaCry spread rapidly across the world, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in over
                        150 countries. Many cybersecurity agencies and governments have attributed the creation and
                        deployment of WannaCry to state-sponsored hackers linked to North Korea, who were allegedly
                        motivated by financial gain and possibly by political goals.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p>North Korea has been linked to several criminal activities like counterfeiting money and
                            pharmaceuticals as they needed ways to raise money after being heavily sanctioned. They also
                            started launching multiple cyber attacks around the globe as another criminal way to get
                            money. At one point, a majority of cyber attacks in South Korea were believed to come from
                            North Korea, a country with less than 10,000 IP addresses.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The malware demanded payment in Bitcoin to a specific non-traceable wallet that would supposedly
                        unlock infected systems once payment was received. The usage of cryptocurrency made tracing the
                        attackers more difficult.</p>

            <h2>Cause</h2>
            <div class="cause-grid">
                <div class="cause-image">
                    <img src="images/cyber.jpg" class="image-2" alt="image">
                </div>
                <div class="cause-text">
                    <p>This attack was made possible due to a serious security vulnerability present in Microsoft
                        Windows known as EternalBlue, which had originally been discovered by the U.S. National Security
                        Agency (NSA) months prior to the actual attack.</p>

                    <p>Instead of reporting the flaw to Microsoft immediately and risking the information getting leaked
                        and vulnerability exploited, the NSA allegedly kept it as a powerful cyber weapon for
                        intelligence operations.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p>The hacking group Shadow Brokers later leaked the vulnerability online in various illegal
                            hacker forums, allowing criminal groups to develop ransomware using it. The difficulty was
                            that even though many hackers now had access to this dangerous cyber weapon, they still
                            hadn't figured out how to use it correctly. The North Korean hackers were the first to do
                            so, having full access and understanding of this leaked information.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Once a machine was infected, WannaCry would automatically spread across networks without user
                        action, keeping a low profile but without doing catastrophic damage immediately. Instead, it
                        gave attackers the option to put more malicious content into the system, while also encrypting
                        files and displaying a ransom note that threatened permanent data loss if payment was not made.

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <div class="impact-content">

                <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) was among the most heavily affected organizations because
                    many of its computers were still running outdated Windows systems lacking important security
                    patches. In fact, a patch was released a week prior to the attack that actually fixed the
                    exploited vulnerability. The issue was that many people were not updating their systems due to
                    laziness, habit, or convenience.</p>

                <div class="stats-grid">
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h3 class="stat-number">80+</h3>
                        <p>NHS trusts disrupted</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h3 class="stat-number">1/3</h3>
                        <p>Medical institutions in the UK affected</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h3 class="stat-number">£92M</h3>
                        <p>Estimated cost to the NHS</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card">
                        <h3 class="stat-number">19,000</h3>
                        <p>Appointments cancelled</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>As a result, over 80 NHS trusts were disrupted, and hospitals lost access to critical digital
                    systems, including patient records, appointment schedules, and diagnostic equipment. Ambulances
                    had to be diverted, surgeries were delayed or cancelled, and medical staff were forced to rely
                    on paper-based procedures.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>The temporary solution was to keep doing what they did in the past - operating the healthcare
                        system in an "old fashioned way" without computers. While no patient deaths were directly
                        attributed to the attack, it significantly reduced the NHS's ability to deliver urgent care.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>Overall, the WannaCry attack became a wake-up call in the field of informatics, healthcare
                    technology, and especially cybersecurity. It showed how dependent essential public services have
                    become on digital infrastructure and how a single vulnerability can lead to massive real-world
                    consequences that may also cause death in the worst case.</p>

                <p>The incident pushed governments and healthcare institutions worldwide to prioritize regular
                    system updates, network segmentation, data backups, and stronger cybersecurity policies.
                    WannaCry also highlighted the growing risks of cyberwarfare tools falling into the hands of
                    criminals, reinforcing the need for global cooperation in protecting critical infrastructure
                    from future cyberattacks.</p>
