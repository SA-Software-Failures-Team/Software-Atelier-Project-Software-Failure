            <h1>Mitigation for the Future - Philips IntelliBridge EC40/80 Gateways (2022)</h1>

            <div id="main">
                <p id="first">
                    The Philips IntelliBridge EC40/80 vulnerability incident emphasized the urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity controls across medical device ecosystems. 
                    Future mitigation must focus on eliminating legacy practices such as hard-coded credentials and inadequate authentication, while adopting modern frameworks for secure device management and monitoring. 
                    A proactive and collaborative security model is essential to ensure the safety and integrity of connected healthcare systems.

                    <p id="second">
                        One of the most important mitigation strategies involves enforcing <strong>strong identity and access management (IAM)</strong> across all medical devices. 
                        Manufacturers should implement unique, changeable credentials for each device, disable default logins, and require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative access. 
                        Healthcare providers must also maintain strict access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with patient-monitoring systems.
                        <br>Another key step is <strong>network segmentation and continuous monitoring</strong>. 
                        Medical gateways should always operate on isolated networks, separated from hospital administrative or public-facing systems. 
                        Implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and continuous logging helps detect unauthorized access attempts early. 
                        Regular penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and firmware audits should be scheduled to ensure that device software remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

                <p id="fourth">
                    From a governance perspective, mitigation requires <strong>shared accountability</strong> between manufacturers, healthcare institutions, and regulators. 
                    Establishing standard protocols for vulnerability disclosure and timely patch management ensures faster response when flaws are discovered. 
                    Training biomedical and IT staff on device cybersecurity best practices can further reduce risks arising from human error or misconfiguration.
                </p>

                <p id="fifth">
                    Finally, the healthcare sector must invest in <strong>cyber resilience and secure design culture</strong>. 
                    This means integrating cybersecurity into every stage of a product's lifecycle — from concept and development to deployment and decommissioning. 
                    Future medical devices must be built with the expectation of cyber threats, not the assumption of safety. 
                    The Philips IntelliBridge case serves as a lasting reminder that patient safety and cybersecurity are inseparable, and that prevention through design is the only sustainable path forward.
