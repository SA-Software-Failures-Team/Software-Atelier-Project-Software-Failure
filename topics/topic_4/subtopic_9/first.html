            <h1>What Happened - Philips IntelliBridge EC40/80 Gateways (2022)</h1>
            <p>
                In 2022, cybersecurity researchers identified several critical vulnerabilities in Philips' IntelliBridge EC40 and EC80 data gateways — medical devices used globally to connect patient monitoring systems with hospital electronic medical records (EMR). 
                These gateways play a central role in transmitting real-time patient vital data, making their reliability and security essential in clinical environments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The most severe issue involved <strong>hard-coded credentials</strong> embedded within the firmware of the devices. 
                These credentials were identical across all deployed systems, allowing anyone with knowledge of them to gain remote access. 
                Once connected, an attacker could view or alter configuration settings, extract sensitive patient data, or disrupt how the gateway communicated with hospital networks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Security testing revealed that the gateways also lacked strong access controls and failed to enforce proper network segmentation, leaving them exposed to unauthorized users on the same network segment. 
                These weaknesses meant that a malicious actor could potentially interfere with patient data transmissions or modify the data integrity of connected systems.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Philips confirmed the vulnerabilities and worked with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to assess the risks. 
                CISA issued an advisory highlighting the potential for remote exploitation, classifying the vulnerabilities as high-severity and assigning them identifiers under the CVE-2022-30277 grouping.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While there were no reports of active exploitation, the discovery prompted urgent advisories across the healthcare sector. 
                Philips released software updates and mitigation guidelines to hospitals, emphasizing the importance of applying patches and securing medical networks. 
                The incident underscored the ongoing cybersecurity challenges within connected medical devices and the potential consequences of weak authentication mechanisms.
