            <h1>Impact & Scope of the Vulnerability - Philips IntelliBridge EC40/80 Gateways (2022)</h1>
            <br>

            <p id="first">
                The vulnerabilities discovered in Philips IntelliBridge EC40 and EC80 gateways presented a significant risk to global healthcare infrastructure. 
                These devices serve as intermediaries between patient monitoring systems and electronic medical records (EMR), meaning any compromise could directly affect the integrity and confidentiality of patient data. 
                Although no real-world exploitation was confirmed, the potential consequences of remote access to these devices were severe — ranging from unauthorized data extraction to the manipulation of vital sign information being transmitted across hospital systems.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p id="second">
                The exposure risk extended across hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities worldwide that utilized these gateways as part of their monitoring networks. 
                If an attacker exploited the hard-coded credentials, they could have gained administrative access to modify configurations, intercept communications, or disable device functionality. 
                This could not only jeopardize patient privacy but also disrupt clinical workflows, resulting in delayed alarms, inaccurate readings, or interruptions in continuous patient monitoring. 
                Given the critical role of these devices in intensive care and surgical environments, such disruptions could have direct implications for patient safety.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p id="third">
                From a regulatory and operational perspective, the incident triggered high concern from both cybersecurity agencies and healthcare compliance bodies. 
                The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) classified the flaws as <strong>high severity</strong> under <strong>CVE-2022-30277</strong>, with a CVSS v3 score of 7.6. 
                Healthcare organizations were urged to apply immediate mitigations and network restrictions. 
                The scope of affected systems included hospitals in multiple regions, emphasizing the interconnected nature of modern medical networks. 
                While no outage occurred on the scale of a ransomware event, the vulnerabilities exposed how deeply intertwined patient safety and cybersecurity have become in the medical technology ecosystem.
