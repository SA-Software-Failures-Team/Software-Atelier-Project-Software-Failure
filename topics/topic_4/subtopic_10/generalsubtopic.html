                <h2>Change Healthcare Ransomware Breach (2024)</h2>
                <p>
                    In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a major U.S. health payment processor owned by UnitedHealth Group, suffered one of the largest healthcare cyber incidents in recent history. 
                    The company's systems were infiltrated through a ransomware attack that disrupted nationwide healthcare payment processing and exposed vast amounts of protected health information (PHI). 
                    The incident underscored the fragility of interconnected healthcare networks and the growing risks posed by sophisticated cybercriminals targeting critical infrastructure.
