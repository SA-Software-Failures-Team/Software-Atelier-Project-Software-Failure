            <h1>What Happened - Change Healthcare Ransomware Breach (Feb 2024)</h1>
            <p>
                In February 2024, Change Healthcare, one of the largest health payment processors in the United States and a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was struck by a devastating ransomware attack. 
                The attackers infiltrated the company's network using stolen credentials, gaining unauthorized access to systems responsible for processing healthcare payments, insurance claims, and pharmacy transactions nationwide.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once inside, the threat actors deployed ransomware that encrypted critical systems, effectively halting Change Healthcare's operations. 
                This shutdown disrupted the flow of payments between hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers, forcing many organizations to revert to manual billing processes. 
                Pharmacies across the U.S. reported issues processing prescriptions, while medical providers faced delays in insurance claims and reimbursements.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The cybercriminal group responsible for the attack, later identified as ALPHV/BlackCat, demanded a ransom to decrypt the data and prevent the release of stolen information. 
                In the following days, the company worked with federal authorities and cybersecurity experts to contain the breach, but the attack's impact rippled across the entire healthcare sector. 
                Sensitive data, including patient records, insurance details, and payment information, was confirmed to have been compromised.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The immediate effect was operational paralysis. Pharmacies, hospitals, and insurance providers were unable to communicate effectively through Change Healthcare's systems, creating massive bottlenecks in patient care and payment processing. 
                The incident highlighted just how dependent the U.S. healthcare infrastructure had become on centralized third-party service providers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the following weeks, Change Healthcare began restoring services in phases, prioritizing critical operations like prescription processing. 
                However, full recovery took months, and the financial and reputational damage was severe. 
                The breach became a defining example of how ransomware can cripple essential public services when cybersecurity practices and network segmentation are insufficient.
