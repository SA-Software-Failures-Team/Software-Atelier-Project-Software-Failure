            <h1>Impact and Global Scope</h1>
            <p>
                The WannaCry attack caused widespread disruption across multiple sectors. The <strong>UK National Health Service</strong> canceled nearly 19,000 appointments, diverted ambulances, and temporarily shut down hospital networks. Other affected sectors included telecommunications, manufacturing, and government agencies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Globally, more than 230,000 computers in 150+ countries were infected, highlighting the attack’s scale. Although ransomware payments were minimal (around $140,000 in Bitcoin), the operational and financial damages were estimated at billions of dollars, including lost productivity, downtime, and emergency response costs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The incident emphasized the risks associated with legacy systems, insufficient patch management, and inadequate cybersecurity awareness. It also prompted governments and organizations to reevaluate security policies, network segmentation, and disaster recovery planning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                WannaCry’s rapid spread demonstrated that even a single vulnerability could have global repercussions, affecting patient care, business continuity, and public trust.
