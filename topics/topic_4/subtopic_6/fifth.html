                The WannaCry ransomware wasn’t the work of random hackers — it’s widely believed to have come from North Korea. Investigations by cybersecurity experts and government agencies around the world pointed to a group known as the Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored hacking organization with ties to North Korea’s intelligence service.

            <p>
                The Lazarus Group has a long history of high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and several major bank heists. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice formally charged a North Korean programmer named Park Jin Hyok, accusing him of helping create and spread WannaCry.

                According to researchers, the group reused bits of code and attack methods seen in earlier Lazarus operations, making the link difficult to ignore. The evidence — from the malware’s structure to specific IP addresses — consistently pointed back to North Korean sources.

                North Korea, of course, denied any involvement, calling the accusations “absurd.” But for most cybersecurity professionals, the consensus is clear: WannaCry was not just a random cybercrime — it was a state-backed attack that got out of control and ended up disrupting hospitals, businesses, and governments worldwide.
