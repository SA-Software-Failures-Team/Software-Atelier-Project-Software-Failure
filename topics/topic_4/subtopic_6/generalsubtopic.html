                <h2>WannaCry: The Digital Pandemic</h2>
                <p>
                    In May 2017, the world witnessed one of the fastest-spreading cyberattacks in history. The WannaCry ransomware swept across more than 150 countries in just a few hours, locking computers and demanding Bitcoin ransoms. Hospitals, companies, and even government systems were suddenly paralyzed - most famously, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) was forced to cancel thousands of appointments and divert ambulances.
Curious to know how it happened, who was behind it, and what we learned from it?
Dive into the sections below to explore the full story - from the technical roots to the global impact of the attack.
