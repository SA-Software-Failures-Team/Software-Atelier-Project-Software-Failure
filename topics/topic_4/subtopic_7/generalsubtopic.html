                <h2>US Medical Imaging Servers Exposed (2019): When Health Data Went Public</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2019, a shocking discovery revealed that thousands of American patients had their medical scans freely accessible on the internet. 
It wasn’t the result of a hacker attack or a sophisticated breach, but rather a chain of missteps, outdated systems, and overlooked configurations. Sensitive medical data — names, birth dates, even diagnoses — were left floating in the open web for anyone to find.
Curious to know how this happened, who was responsible, and what it taught the world about securing healthcare data? Dive into the pages below to uncover the full story.
