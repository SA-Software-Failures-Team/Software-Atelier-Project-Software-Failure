                    The Therac-25 accidents resulted in <strong>at least six known cases</strong> of massive radiation overexposure between 1985 and 1987. 
                    Three patients died directly from radiation injuries, while others suffered lifelong disabilities such as 
                    paralysis, severe tissue necrosis, and chronic pain.

                    The incidents occurred at major medical centers in <strong>Tyler (Texas), Hamilton (Ontario), and Marietta (Georgia)</strong>. 
                    Each facility independently reported unexplained patient injuries, yet manufacturer responses were slow 
                    and inconsistent. AECL initially denied that the machine could cause overdoses, delaying recognition of 
                    a systemic fault.

                    Beyond the human toll, the Therac-25 case transformed perceptions of software reliability in medicine. 
                    It revealed the dangers of unverified code, opaque design practices, and the absence of independent safety audits. 
                    The events prompted intense scrutiny from regulators, professional societies, and academic researchers.

                <p id="fourth">
                    The impact extended globally. Universities introduced software safety curricula; 
                    engineering ethics programs used Therac-25 as a case study; and the <strong>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong> 
                    overhauled its medical device software review standards. The case became a foundational lesson 
                    in the history of socio-technical system design.
