            <h2>What Happened — The Therac-25 Radiation Overdose</h2>
            <p>
                Between <strong>1985 and 1987</strong>, six patients in the United States and Canada suffered massive radiation overdoses 
                from a computer-controlled therapy machine known as the <strong>Therac-25</strong>, manufactured by <em>Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)</em>. 
                The device, designed to deliver high-energy electron and X-ray beams for cancer treatment, was considered a technological 
                breakthrough at the time — the first fully software-controlled linear accelerator.
            </p>

            <p>
                The accidents began subtly. Patients complained of unexpected burning sensations during treatment sessions. 
                Over subsequent days, severe radiation injuries emerged: tissue destruction, nerve damage, and fatal overdoses 
                equivalent to tens of thousands of rads. Operators, trusting the software’s display that indicated “no dose delivered,” 
                were initially unaware that catastrophic overdoses had occurred.
            </p>

            <p>
                At least <strong>six known incidents</strong> took place in hospitals across <strong>Texas, Georgia, and Ontario</strong>. 
                In each case, the machine’s safety interlocks failed silently due to software race conditions. 
                Investigations revealed that patients had received radiation levels hundreds of times higher than prescribed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite early warnings from hospitals, the manufacturer initially treated each event as isolated operator error. 
                Only after the final incidents in 1987 did the full scope of the design flaws become evident, 
                marking the Therac-25 as one of the most infamous examples of software-induced medical accidents.
