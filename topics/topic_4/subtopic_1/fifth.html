            <h1>Future Outlook & Preventive Measures</h1>
            <br>

            <p>
                The legacy of the Therac-25 accidents reshaped global approaches to medical device safety. 
                The lessons learned catalyzed improvements in design, regulation, and oversight — ensuring 
                such a failure could never happen again.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2>1. Technological Safeguards</h2>
            <p>
                Modern radiotherapy systems employ <strong>hardware–software redundancy</strong>, independent dose monitoring, 
                and built-in diagnostics to prevent unsafe configurations. 
                Interlocks now operate at both mechanical and digital levels, 
                guaranteeing treatment interruption under abnormal conditions.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Independent Dose Verification:</strong> Dual measurement systems continuously 
                    cross-check radiation output to detect any mismatch between planned and delivered doses.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Enhanced Interface Design:</strong> Human–machine interfaces now use clear feedback, 
                    intuitive alerts, and fail-safe prompts to reduce operator error.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Automatic Error Logging:</strong> Continuous digital records allow traceability and 
                    facilitate rapid fault diagnosis.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>2. Regulatory Reform</h2>
            <p>
                In the aftermath, agencies like the <strong>FDA</strong> and <strong>Health Canada</strong> established 
                formal guidelines for <strong>software validation and risk assessment</strong> in medical devices. 
                These frameworks require exhaustive testing, documentation, and pre-market review for all control systems.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Mandatory Software Validation:</strong> Manufacturers must prove software reliability 
                    through structured verification and validation before clinical deployment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Post-Market Surveillance:</strong> Ongoing monitoring ensures any anomalies or adverse 
                    events are quickly reported and analyzed.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>International Safety Standards:</strong> Standards such as <em>IEC 62304</em> and 
                    <em>ISO 14971</em> define global requirements for software lifecycle management and risk mitigation.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>3. Organizational and Cultural Change</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond technology and regulation, the Therac-25 tragedy underscored the importance of a 
                <strong>safety-oriented culture</strong> within healthcare institutions and manufacturers alike.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Transparent Reporting:</strong> A non-punitive environment encourages open discussion 
                    of software faults, near misses, and operator concerns.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration:</strong> Engineers, clinicians, and regulators now 
                    work together to evaluate risks and ensure patient safety at every stage of system development.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Continuous Education:</strong> Training programs emphasize the human factors 
                    involved in software-based medical systems and the critical importance of vigilance.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <h2>4. Future Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                As radiotherapy technology evolves, safety continues to advance through <strong>AI-driven dose modeling</strong>, 
                <strong>machine learning error prediction</strong>, and <strong>automated treatment verification</strong>. 
                These innovations promise precision and safety beyond human capability, while preserving the lessons 
                learned from past failures.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Therac-25 disaster remains a cornerstone in the history of medical safety engineering — 
                a reminder that <em>software is not infallible</em>, and that human lives depend on the 
                continuous balance between innovation, regulation, and ethical responsibility.
