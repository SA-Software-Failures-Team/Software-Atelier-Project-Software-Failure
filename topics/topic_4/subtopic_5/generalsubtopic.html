                <h2>Baxter Colleague Infusion Pump Recall (2010)</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2010, Baxter International faced one of the most significant medical device recalls in U.S. history when its Colleague infusion pumps were found to malfunction in hospitals nationwide. 
                    These devices, which deliver precise doses of fluids or medication to patients, could continue infusing even after clinicians pressed the “stop” button, creating serious patient safety risks. 
                    Following multiple complaints and FDA warnings, Baxter halted sales and recalled all units. 
                    This incident highlighted the critical importance of software reliability in life-critical medical devices and reshaped regulatory and industry safety practices.
