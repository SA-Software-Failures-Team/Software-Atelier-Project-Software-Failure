            <h1>Impact & Scope - Baxter Colleague Infusion Pump Recall (2010)</h1>
            <br>

            <p id="first">
                The Baxter Colleague infusion pump recall affected hospitals and healthcare providers across the United States. 
                Thousands of devices were in operation in critical care units, meaning that both routine and emergency medication delivery was potentially compromised. 
                Clinical staff faced the challenge of identifying affected pumps, removing them from service, and implementing alternative methods for patient infusion, creating significant operational strain.

            <p id="second">
                The malfunction of these pumps, which continued to infuse medication even after a stop command, resulted in at least one reported patient injury. 
                While the total number of adverse events may have been higher, widespread underreporting is common in medical device incidents. 
                The recall encompassed tens of thousands of units, leading to massive disruption in hospital workflows, especially in intensive care units and other high-dependency settings.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p id="third">
                Financially, the recall imposed millions of dollars in costs on Baxter for device replacement, regulatory compliance, and legal settlements. 
                Hospitals also incurred additional expenses due to staff overtime, device replacement, and patient monitoring during the transition. 
                The event highlighted the critical importance of device reliability in patient safety and demonstrated how even a single firmware flaw can have far-reaching consequences across healthcare delivery systems.
