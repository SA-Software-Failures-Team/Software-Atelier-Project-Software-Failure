            <h1>What Happened - Baxter Colleague Infusion Pump Recall (2010)</h1>
            <p>
                In 2010, Baxter International recalled its Colleague infusion pumps after hospitals across the United States reported malfunctions. 
                These devices, responsible for delivering intravenous medications and fluids, sometimes failed to stop infusions even after clinicians pressed the “stop” button, creating serious patient safety risks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over the years leading up to the recall, hospitals noticed irregular behaviors, including delayed start-up, display errors, and failure to halt medication flow. 
                Despite attempts to release firmware updates, the issues persisted, prompting investigations by the FDA and Baxter. 
                The problems were serious enough to warrant a nationwide recall and cessation of sales for all Colleague pumps.

            <p>
                The malfunction of the pumps directly impacted patient safety, with at least one reported injury and multiple near-miss incidents. 
                Hospitals were forced to rely on manual infusion methods while awaiting replacement devices, creating operational challenges. 
                The recall represented one of the most significant medical device safety interventions of that period, affecting thousands of healthcare facilities nationwide.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The FDA ordered Baxter to remove all Colleague pumps from circulation and issue guidance to hospitals on mitigating risks, underscoring the severity of the situation. 
                The recall also led to legal and financial consequences for Baxter, highlighting the importance of rigorous software and firmware validation in life-critical medical devices.
