                    <p id="first">
                        Between August 2000 and March 2001, a total of <strong>28 patients</strong> with prostate and cervical cancer 
                        were overexposed during radiotherapy sessions at the National Oncology Institute in Panama City. 
                        The overdoses ranged from <strong>20% to more than 100%</strong> above prescribed levels, leading to 
                        severe radiation injuries and, ultimately, multiple fatalities.

                    <p id="second">
                        Within months, many patients developed symptoms of radiation toxicity, including tissue necrosis, 
                        intestinal damage, and severe pelvic inflammation. Despite efforts to manage these effects, 
                        <strong>8 patients died directly from radiation-induced injuries</strong>, while others experienced 
                        permanent complications that severely reduced their quality of life.

                        The event also had deep systemic consequences. The Panamanian Ministry of Health temporarily 
                        suspended the hospital’s radiotherapy program, and international agencies such as the 
                        <strong>IAEA</strong> and the <strong>Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)</strong> launched a full investigation. 
                        The case revealed gaps in <strong>software validation, regulatory oversight, and staff training</strong> 
                        that extended beyond Panama, influencing global safety standards in radiotherapy.

                        The accident’s impact was not limited to the affected patients — it disrupted public trust in 
                        radiotherapy, led to new safety audits across Latin America, and triggered an international 
                        reevaluation of <strong>treatment planning software safety certification</strong>. The tragedy became a 
                        defining moment in modern radiological protection history.
