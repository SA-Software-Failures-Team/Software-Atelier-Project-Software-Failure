            <br>

            <p id="first">
                The Panama City radiotherapy accident (2000–2001) stemmed from a critical programming error in the 
                treatment planning system used at the National Oncology Institute (ION). After software upgrades, 
                medical physicists had to manually define shielding blocks in the <strong>Multidata Model 2</strong> system. 
                A new input method introduced ambiguity in how dose regions were calculated, allowing multiple 
                field blocks to overlap improperly.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p id="second">
                The error occurred because the <strong>treatment planning software miscalculated dose distributions</strong> 
                when more than four shielding blocks were inserted. The system’s algorithm failed to correctly 
                normalize the dose, resulting in <strong>up to 100% higher delivered doses</strong> than prescribed in some 
                cases. The interface provided no clear warning or validation message to indicate an abnormal 
                dose level. This fault went unnoticed for months due to the absence of independent cross-checks 
                or dose verification procedures.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p id="third">
                Contributing factors included poor communication between the hospital, the equipment manufacturer, 
                and the national regulator. The lack of formal <strong>quality assurance (QA) protocols</strong>, independent 
                verification of software upgrades, and insufficient staff training compounded the problem. 
                Subsequent forensic testing confirmed that the software behaved correctly with up to four 
                blocks but failed beyond that limit — a flaw that should have been detected during acceptance 
                testing.
