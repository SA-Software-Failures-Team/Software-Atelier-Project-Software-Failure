            <h2>Incident Overview — The Panama City Radiotherapy Accident</h2>
            <p>In late <strong>2000</strong>, routine cancer treatments at Panama’s <em>National Oncology Institute</em> began under a familiar rhythm: carefully planned radiation sessions guided by a trusted treatment-planning software from <strong>Multidata Systems International</strong>. Unknown to the team, the software carried a flaw that would turn ordinary care into tragedy.</p>

            <p>The Multidata system misinterpreted multiple shielding blocks used to shape the radiation beam. When more than one block was entered, the program calculated an incorrect blocked area, assuming less shielding than actually present. This subtle error caused the program to prescribe a <strong>higher-than-intended dose</strong> of radiation for several patients.</p>

            <p>Over the following months, staff began noticing alarming side effects: severe burns, organ damage, and complications that exceeded normal expectations for radiotherapy. By early <strong>2001</strong>, the pattern could no longer be ignored. Medical physicists reviewed treatment logs and quickly identified that the common factor was the use of multiple shielding blocks within the flawed planning software.</p>

            <p>The hospital immediately suspended all treatments using the Multidata system and notified the Ministry of Health. Investigations led by both national authorities and the <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</strong> confirmed that <strong>28 patients</strong> had received overdoses — some by more than double the prescribed amount. At least eight later died from radiation-related injuries.</p>

            <p>This event revealed how a single line of code could breach the trust between technology and medicine. What had appeared to be a small computational detail became one of the most serious radiotherapy accidents in modern medical history, exposing weaknesses in software validation and independent dose verification.</p>
