                The launch of the website Healthcare.gov in October 2013 was envisioned to be the crowning achievement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of the Obama administration, a seamless digital gateway to be used by millions of Americans to obtain access to basic health insurance. Instead, it became a landmark case study in catastrophic software failure and its consequences, and a very painful and public demonstration of how a complex technological project can collapse under the weight of its own ambitions.

            <p id="second">
                For the first crucial weeks of its existence, the website was, for most users, utterly unusable. The pages took minutes to load, if they even loaded at all, before crashing with error messages. The "digital front door" to healthcare reform was getting slammed shut, creating a political storm and a big national embarrassment.

            <p id="third">
                Unfortunately this was not a simple glitch but rather a systemic breakdown, a failure that managed to expose profound flaws in how these large scale government IT projects were created, managed, and executed, with lasting implications for software development everywhere in the country. The Healthcare.gov launch became a cautionary tale about what happens when technical complexity meets political pressure without proper project management.
