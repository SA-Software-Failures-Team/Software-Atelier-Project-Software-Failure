                <h2>Healthcare.gov Launch Failure (2013)</h2>
                <p>
                    The launch of Healthcare.gov in October 2013 was envisioned as the crowning achievement of the Affordable Care Act but became a landmark case study in catastrophic software failure. The website was utterly unusable for most users, with pages taking minutes to load and frequent crashes, creating a political storm and national embarrassment that exposed profound flaws in large-scale government IT project management.
