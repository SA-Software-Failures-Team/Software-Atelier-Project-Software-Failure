            <h1>Immense Technical Complexity & Political Pressure</h1>
            <p>
                The context in which Healthcare.gov was built was one of immense technical complexity and intense political pressure coming from the need of maintaining previously made political promises. The website's mandate was extraordinarily ambitious from the beginning: to function as a real time, secure eligibility tool and insurance marketplace in which you would be able to select the best possible insurance for your specific budget and financial possibilities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It had to be integrated in a seamless way with a vast number of disparate and already aging federal systems and software, including those of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to verify income and then tax accordingly to fund governments actions, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for citizenship checks and internal security, and aged and diverse individual state Medicaid databases.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, it needed to pull an accurate up to date plan and pricing information from hundreds of private insurance companies to then allow users to select their own insurance using one only platform. And all of this had to be presented using a user friendly interface that could guide every type of individual through a complex decision making process that required certain financial and medical knowledge to choose the best possible option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding this technical challenge was the highly divided political environment. The ACA was the signature policy of the Obama administration that was in charge, and its opponents were ready to pounce on any possible failure. This immense pressure and divide created a "launch at all costs" type of mentality, where delaying the October 1st deadline was seen as political suicide cause many voters were in actual need of this, leading to a premature release of a unready software.
