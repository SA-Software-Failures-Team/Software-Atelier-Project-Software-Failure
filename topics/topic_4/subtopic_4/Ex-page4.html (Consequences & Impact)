            <h2>Public Health Consequences</h2>
            <p>The consequences of this failure were immediate, severe, and multi layered and faceted. The most direct impact was surely on the American public, who were legally mandated to have health insurance but were systematically prevented from obtaining it through the newly designated marketplace. This reduced public trust not only in the website but in the ACA itself and in the government's competence to manage complex such a complex and much needed technology.</p>

            <h2>Political Fallout</h2>
            <p>Politically it was a devastating blow to the entire administration, dominating news cycles for weeks and providing potent ammunition and arguments to its critics and opposition. The failure became a symbol of government incompetence and fueled political debates about the viability of the Affordable Care Act itself.</p>

            <h2>Financial Costs</h2>
            <p>Financially, the cost was significant; the initial build cost hundreds of millions of tax payer dollars, and the subsequent tech surge to rescue the failing project, which brought in top talent from Silicon Valley, and required tens of millions more in emergency funding. The total cost of the recovery effort added substantially to the original project budget.</p>
